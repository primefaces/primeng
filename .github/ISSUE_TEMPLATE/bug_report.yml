        ## Overview


        PrimeNG receives close to 2 million downloads per month. As any other popular OSS project, you may understand that the core team does not have the bandwidth to review each and every issue in detail in their daily routines. We have established strict guidelines for issue creation to ensure we can effectively address issues. It will help us prioritize and manage our workload efficiently.


        Adhering to these guidelines, you help us maintain and improve the project more effectively. If you'd like to get our detailed attention, consider PrimeNG PRO Support instead, which provides support within one business day. Thank you for your cooperation and contributions!


        ## Issue Creation Guidelines


        To help us assist you better, please follow these mandatory requirements when creating an issue:


        **Important:** Our bot will automatically close issues that do not follow these guidelines.


        ### Reproducer


        Provide a clear and concise executable example that reproduces the issue based on our StackBlitz template.


        ### PrimeNG Version

        Ensure that you are using PrimeNG version v20. Issues related to other versions will not be reviewed as they are part of PrimeNG LTS, which has an internal ticket management system.


        ### Provide a Pull Request

        We highly encourage contributions from the community! If you have the time and ability, consider submitting a pull request to address this issue. Here's how you can get started:

          1. Fork the repository.
          2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeatureName`).
          3. Run "npm run dev" command to deploy the showcase locally using the monorepo.
          4. Make your changes.
          5. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
          6. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeatureName`).
          7. Open a pull request.

        ### Reason for No PR


        If you are unable to provide a PR, please explain why. Understanding the reasons can help us improve and assist you in contributing.


        ### Discussions and Questions


        Please refrain from creating issue tickets for questions or support requests. Instead, use the GitHub Discussions or join the PrimeLand  Discord server for assistance.
