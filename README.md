See  [PrimeNG homepage](http://www.primefaces.org/primeng) for live showcase and documentation.

Execute the following commands to run the showcase in your local environment. A browser window pops up with http:\\\\localhost:3000 address.

```
npm install      //install modules
typings install  //install tsd files via typings
tsc              //compile typescript files
npm start        //start the server
```

When the server is started, it would be in development mode so that changing a file refreshes the browser. Changing a typescript file would compile
it on save which in turn triggers a reload for the browser as well.
