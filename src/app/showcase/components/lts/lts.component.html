    <h5>What is LTS?</h5>
    <p>Angular is a fast paced technology with a new major version
        <a href="https://angular.io/guide/releases">every 6 months</a>. PrimeNG release cycle is aligned with Angular and every 6 months a new major PrimeNG version is released that is compatible
        with the latest Angular core. We are aware that majority of the existing applications prefer to remain at a previous version due to stability requirements instead of upgrading to the latest version immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
        PrimeNG LTS is an annual subscription based service to provide a license for the finest compatible version suited to you. LTS covers the prior two versions from the latest release, this means up to <b>18 months</b>
        of almost weekly releases to bring the latest defect fixes and security updates to your project. As an example, when PrimeNG moves to Angular 9, PrimeNG 7 and 8 will move to LTS support whereas STS (short term support)
        versions of PrimeNG 9 will be open source under MIT license for at least 6 months until PrimeNG 10 is released. Here is a timeline to visualize the LTS support.</p>
