                Tailwind CSS is a popular CSS framework based on a utility-first design. The core provides flexible CSS classes with
                predefined CSS rules to build your own UI elements. For example, instead of an opinionated <i>btn</i> class as in Bootstrap,
                Tailwind offers primitive classes like <i>bg-blue-500</i>, <i>rounded</i> and <i>p-4</i> to apply a button. A set of
                reusable classes can also be grouped as a Tailwind CSS component and there are even a couple of libraries that take this
                approach to build components specifically for Tailwind.

                Tailwind is an outstanding CSS library, however it lacks a true comprehensive UI suite when combined with Vue.js, this is
                where PrimeVue comes in by providing a wide range of highly accessible and feature rich UI component library. The core of
                PrimeVue does not depend on Tailwind CSS, instead we provide the necessary integration points such as the primeui tailwind
                plugin and the presets for the unstyled mode.
