                Tailwind CSS in particular is a popular choice, we have even built the
                <a href="https://tailwind.primevue.org">Tailwind CSS presets</a> spin-off project for the unstyled mode to be able to use
                the utility classes to style the PrimeVue components. During this work, we've realized that the value added by PrimeFlex
                such as providing the PrimeVue theming as utility classes can be implemented as a Tailwind plugin. As part of PrimeVue v4, a
                tailwind-primeui plugin has been created for the seamless integration, the website templating demos have been migrated from
                PrimeFlex to Tailwind and a converter tool called <i>pf2tw</i> has been created. In summary, PrimeTek officially suggests
                Tailwind CSS as the replacement for PrimeFlex.
