                Themes are created with SASS using the <i>primeng-sass-theme</i> project available at <a href="http://github.com/primefaces/primeng-sass-theme">github</a>. This repository contains all the scss files for the components and the
                variables of the built-in themes so that you may customize an existing theme or create your own. The scss variables used in a theme are available at the
                <a href="https://www.primefaces.org/designer/api/primeng/15.0.0">SASS API</a> documentation.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are 3 alternatives to create your own theme. First option is using the Visual Editor, second one is compiling a theme with command line sass and final alternative is embedding scss files within your project to let your build
                environment do the compilation. In all cases, the generated theme file should be imported to your project. Here is a video tutorial that demonstrates all three options.
            </p>

            <h3>Visual Editor</h3>
            <p>
                <a href="https://designer.primeng.org">Visual Editor</a> is an easy way to quickly customize an existing theme without dealing with the details of the SASS API. The editor allows changing common settings like primary color for
                built-in themes. Once you have completed the design, click the download button to access the generated <i>theme.css</i> file and import it to your project as an asset. In near future, an advanced UI Designer will be available with the
                ability to edit all variables and components where you'll also be able to save your themes when accessed with an account.
            </p>

            <h3>Theme SCSS</h3>
            <p>
                The theme scss is available as open source at <a href="http://github.com/primefaces/primeng-sass-theme">primeng-sass-theme</a> repository. The <i>theme-base</i> folder contains the theming structure of the components, themes under
                <i>themes</i> folder import the base and define the SCSS variables. The <i>themes</i> folder also contains all the built-in themes so you can customize their code as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                To create your own theme, <a href="https://github.com/primefaces/primeng-sass-theme/releases">download</a> the release matching your PrimeNG version and access the <i>themes/mytheme</i> folder. The sass variables to customize are
                available under the <i>variables</i> folder. The <i>_fonts</i> file can be used to define a custom font for your project whereas the optional <i>_extensions</i> file is provided to add overrides to the components designs. The
                <i>theme.scss</i> file imports the theme files along with the <i>theme-base</i> folder at the root to combine everything together. Next step would be compilation of the scss that can either be command line or within your project.
            </p>

            <h3>Compile SCSS Manually</h3>
            <p>Once your theme is ready run the following command to compile it. Note that <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass">sass</a> command should be available in your terminal.</p>
            <app-code [code]="code1" [hideToggleCode]="true"></app-code>
            <p>Then copy and import the theme.css file in your application. For example, in Angular CLI you may place theme.css under assets folder and then import it at <i>styles.css</i>.</p>
            <app-code [code]="code2" [hideToggleCode]="true"></app-code>

            <h3>Build Time Compilation</h3>
            <p>
                This approach eliminates the manual compilation by delegating it to Angular CLI. Copy the <i>theme-base</i> folder along with <i>themes/mytheme</i> folder to your application where assets reside. At a suitable location like
                <i>styles.scss</i>, import the <i>theme.scss</i> from <i>assets/themes/mytheme</i>. That would be it, during build time, your project will compile the sass and import the theme. Any changes to your theme will be reflected instantly.
