                    Menubar component uses the <i>menubar</i> role and the value to describe the menu can either be provided with <i>aria-labelledby</i> or <i>aria-label</i> props. Each list item has a <i>presentation</i> role whereas anchor elements
                    have a <i>menuitem</i> role with <i>aria-label</i> referring to the label of the item and <i>aria-disabled</i> defined if the item is disabled. A submenu within a MenuBar uses the <i>menu</i> role with an
                    <i>aria-labelledby</i> defined as the id of the submenu root menuitem label. In addition, menuitems that open a submenu have <i>aria-haspopup</i>, <i>aria-expanded</i> and <i>aria-controls</i> to define the relation between the
                    item and the submenu.
                </p>

                    describe the button can be defined <i>aria-label</i> or <i>aria-labelledby</i> specified using <i>buttonProps</i>, by default <i>navigation</i> key of the <i>aria</i> property from the
                    <a href="/configuration/#locale">locale</a> API as the <i>aria-label</i>.
