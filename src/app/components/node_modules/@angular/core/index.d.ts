 * ### Example with NgModule-based application

 *  function initializeApp(): Promise<any> {

 *      // Do some asynchronous stuff
 *      resolve();
 *    });
 *  }

 *   declarations: [AppComponent],
 *   bootstrap: [AppComponent],
 *   providers: [{
 *     provide: APP_INITIALIZER,
 *     useFactory: () => initializeApp,
 *     multi: true
 *    }]
 *   })
 *  export class AppModule {}
 * ```
 *
 * ### Example with standalone application
 * ```
 * export function initializeApp(http: HttpClient) {
 *   return (): Promise<any> =>
 *     firstValueFrom(
 *       http
 *         .get("https://someUrl.com/api/user")
 *         .pipe(tap(user => { ... }))
 *     );
 * }
 *
 * bootstrapApplication(App, {
 *   providers: [
 *     provideHttpClient(),
 *     {
 *       provide: APP_INITIALIZER,
 *       useFactory: initializeApp,
 *       multi: true,
 *       deps: [HttpClient],
 *     },
 *   ],
 * });

 * ```
 *
 *
 * It's also possible to configure a multi-provider using `APP_INITIALIZER` token and a function
 * returning an observable, see an example below. Note: the `HttpClient` in this example is used for
 * demo purposes to illustrate how the factory function can work with other providers available
 * through DI.
 *
 * ### Example with NgModule-based application
 * ```
 *  function initializeAppFactory(httpClient: HttpClient): () => Observable<any> {
 *   return () => httpClient.get("https://someUrl.com/api/user")
 *     .pipe(
 *        tap(user => { ... })

 *  }

 *     );
 *  }

 *   providers: [
 *     provideHttpClient(),

/**
 * A reference to an Angular application running on a page.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 * {@a is-stable-examples}
 * ### isStable examples and caveats
 *
 * Note two important points about `isStable`, demonstrated in the examples below:
 * - the application will never be stable if you start any kind
 * of recurrent asynchronous task when the application starts
 * (for example for a polling process, started with a `setInterval`, a `setTimeout`
 * or using RxJS operators like `interval`);
 * - the `isStable` Observable runs outside of the Angular zone.
 *
 * Let's imagine that you start a recurrent task
 * (here incrementing a counter, using RxJS `interval`),
 * and at the same time subscribe to `isStable`.
 *
 * ```
 * constructor(appRef: ApplicationRef) {
 *   appRef.isStable.pipe(
 *      filter(stable => stable)
 *   ).subscribe(() => console.log('App is stable now');
 *   interval(1000).subscribe(counter => console.log(counter));
 * }
 * ```
 * In this example, `isStable` will never emit `true`,
 * and the trace "App is stable now" will never get logged.
 *
 * If you want to execute something when the app is stable,
 * you have to wait for the application to be stable
 * before starting your polling process.
 *
 * ```
 * constructor(appRef: ApplicationRef) {
 *   appRef.isStable.pipe(
 *     first(stable => stable),
 *     tap(stable => console.log('App is stable now')),
 *     switchMap(() => interval(1000))
 *   ).subscribe(counter => console.log(counter));
 * }
 * ```
 * In this example, the trace "App is stable now" will be logged
 * and then the counter starts incrementing every second.
 *
 * Note also that this Observable runs outside of the Angular zone,
 * which means that the code in the subscription
 * to this Observable will not trigger the change detection.
 *
 * Let's imagine that instead of logging the counter value,
 * you update a field of your component
 * and display it in its template.
 *
 * ```
 * constructor(appRef: ApplicationRef) {
 *   appRef.isStable.pipe(
 *     first(stable => stable),
 *     switchMap(() => interval(1000))
 *   ).subscribe(counter => this.value = counter);
 * }
 * ```
 * As the `isStable` Observable runs outside the zone,
 * the `value` field will be updated properly,
 * but the template will not be refreshed!
 *
 * You'll have to manually trigger the change detection to update the template.
 *
 * ```
 * constructor(appRef: ApplicationRef, cd: ChangeDetectorRef) {
 *   appRef.isStable.pipe(
 *     first(stable => stable),
 *     switchMap(() => interval(1000))
 *   ).subscribe(counter => {
 *     this.value = counter;
 *     cd.detectChanges();
 *   });
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Or make the subscription callback run inside the zone.
 *
 * ```
 * constructor(appRef: ApplicationRef, zone: NgZone) {
 *   appRef.isStable.pipe(
 *     first(stable => stable),
 *     switchMap(() => interval(1000))
 *   ).subscribe(counter => zone.run(() => this.value = counter));
 * }

     *
     * @usageNotes
     * ### Bootstrap process
     *
     * When bootstrapping a component, Angular mounts it onto a target DOM element
     * and kicks off automatic change detection. The target DOM element can be

     *
     * ### Example
     *
     * Generally, we define the component to bootstrap in the `bootstrap` array of `NgModule`,
     * but it requires us to know the component while writing the application code.
     *
     * Imagine a situation where we have to wait for an API call to decide about the component to
     * bootstrap. We can use the `ngDoBootstrap` hook of the `NgModule` and call this method to
     * dynamically bootstrap a component.
     *
     * {@example core/ts/platform/platform.ts region='componentSelector'}
     *
     * Optionally, a component can be mounted onto a DOM element that does not match the
     * selector of the bootstrapped component.
     *
     * In the following example, we are providing a CSS selector to match the target element.

     * @usageNotes
     *
     * ### Setting component inputs
     *
     * The following example creates a component with two data-bound properties,
     * specified by the `inputs` value.
     *
     * <code-example path="core/ts/metadata/directives.ts" region="component-input"></code-example>
     *
     *
     * ### Setting component outputs
     *
     * The following example shows two event emitters that emit on an interval. One
     * emits an output every second, while the other emits every five seconds.
     *
     * {@example core/ts/metadata/directives.ts region='component-output-interval'}
     *
     * ### Injecting a class with a view provider
     *
     * The following simple example injects a class into a component
     * using the view provider specified in component metadata:
     *
     * ```ts
     * class Greeter {
     *    greet(name:string) {
     *      return 'Hello ' + name + '!';
     *    }
     * }
     *
     * @Directive({
     *   selector: 'needs-greeter'
     * })
     * class NeedsGreeter {
     *   greeter:Greeter;
     *
     *   constructor(greeter:Greeter) {
     *     this.greeter = greeter;
     *   }
     * }
     *
     * @Component({
     *   selector: 'greet',
     *   viewProviders: [
     *     Greeter
     *   ],
     *   template: `<needs-greeter></needs-greeter>`
     * })
     * class HelloWorld {
     * }
     *
     * ```
     *
     * ### Preserving whitespace
     *
     * Removing whitespace can greatly reduce AOT-generated code size and speed up view creation.
     * As of Angular 6, the default for `preserveWhitespaces` is false (whitespace is removed).
     * To change the default setting for all components in your application, set
     * the `preserveWhitespaces` option of the AOT compiler.
     *
     * By default, the AOT compiler removes whitespace characters as follows:
     * * Trims all whitespaces at the beginning and the end of a template.
     * * Removes whitespace-only text nodes. For example,
     *
     * ```html
     * <button>Action 1</button>  <button>Action 2</button>
     * ```
     *
     * becomes:
     *
     * ```html
     * <button>Action 1</button><button>Action 2</button>
     * ```
     *
     * * Replaces a series of whitespace characters in text nodes with a single space.
     * For example, `<span>\n some text\n</span>` becomes `<span> some text </span>`.
     * * Does NOT alter text nodes inside HTML tags such as `<pre>` or `<textarea>`,
     * where whitespace characters are significant.
     *
     * Note that these transformations can influence DOM nodes layout, although impact
     * should be minimal.
     *
     * You can override the default behavior to preserve whitespace characters
     * in certain fragments of a template. For example, you can exclude an entire
     * DOM sub-tree by using the `ngPreserveWhitespaces` attribute:
     *
     * ```html
     * <div ngPreserveWhitespaces>
     *     whitespaces are preserved here
     *     <span>    and here </span>
     * </div>
     * ```
     *
     * You can force a single space to be preserved in a text node by using `&ngsp;`,
     * which is replaced with a space character by Angular's template
     * compiler:
     *

     * @usageNotes
     * To define a directive, mark the class with the decorator and provide metadata.

     *
     * @Directive({
     *   selector: 'my-directive',
     * })
     * export class MyDirective {
     * ...
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * ### Declaring directives
     *
     * In order to make a directive available to other components in your application, you should do
     * one of the following:
     *  - either mark the directive as [standalone](guide/standalone-components),
     *  - or declare it in an NgModule by adding it to the `declarations` and `exports` fields.
     *
     * ** Marking a directive as standalone **
     *
     * You can add the `standalone: true` flag to the Directive decorator metadata to declare it as
     * [standalone](guide/standalone-components):
     *
     * ```ts
     * @Directive({
     *   standalone: true,
     *   selector: 'my-directive',
     * })
     * class MyDirective {}
     * ```
     *
     * When marking a directive as standalone, please make sure that the directive is not already
     * declared in an NgModule.
     *
     *
     * ** Declaring a directive in an NgModule **
     *
     * Another approach is to declare a directive in an NgModule:
     *
     * ```ts
     * @Directive({
     *   selector: 'my-directive',
     * })
     * class MyDirective {}
     *
     * @NgModule({
     *   declarations: [MyDirective, SomeComponent],
     *   exports: [MyDirective], // making it available outside of this module
     * })
     * class SomeNgModule {}
     * ```
     *
     * When declaring a directive in an NgModule, please make sure that:
     *  - the directive is declared in exactly one NgModule.
     *  - the directive is not standalone.
     *  - you do not re-declare a directive imported from another module.
     *  - the directive is included into the `exports` field as well if you want this directive to be
     *    accessible for components outside of the NgModule.

 * other than the hosting component whose template defines it, or it can be defined
 * independently by a `TemplateRef`.
 *
 * Properties of elements in a view can change, but the structure (number and order) of elements in
 * a view cannot. Change the structure of elements by inserting, moving, or
 * removing nested views in a view container.
 *
 * @see {@link ViewContainerRef}
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * The following template breaks down into two separate `TemplateRef` instances,
 * an outer one and an inner one.
 *
 * ```
 * Count: {{items.length}}
 * <ul>
 *   <li *ngFor="let  item of items">{{item}}</li>
 * </ul>
 * ```
 *
 * This is the outer `TemplateRef`:
 *
 * ```
 * Count: {{items.length}}
 * <ul>
 *   <ng-template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]="items"></ng-template>
 * </ul>
 * ```
 *
 * This is the inner `TemplateRef`:
 *
 * ```
 *   <li>{{item}}</li>
 * ```
 *
 * The outer and inner `TemplateRef` instances are assembled into views as follows:
 *
 * ```
 * <!-- ViewRef: outer-0 -->
 * Count: 2
 * <ul>
 *   <ng-template view-container-ref></ng-template>
 *   <!-- ViewRef: inner-1 --><li>first</li><!-- /ViewRef: inner-1 -->

/**
 * Stores a set of OpCodes to process `HostBindingsFunction` associated with a current view.
 *
 * In order to invoke `HostBindingsFunction` we need:
 * 1. 'elementIdx`: Index to the element associated with the `HostBindingsFunction`.
 * 2. 'directiveIdx`: Index to the directive associated with the `HostBindingsFunction`. (This will
 *    become the context for the `HostBindingsFunction` invocation.)
 * 3. `bindingRootIdx`: Location where the bindings for the `HostBindingsFunction` start. Internally
 *    `HostBindingsFunction` binding indexes start from `0` so we need to add `bindingRootIdx` to
 *    it.
 * 4. `HostBindingsFunction`: A host binding function to execute.
 *
 * The above information needs to be encoded into the `HostBindingOpCodes` in an efficient manner.
 *
 * 1. `elementIdx` is encoded into the `HostBindingOpCodes` as `~elementIdx` (so a negative number);
 * 2. `directiveIdx`
 * 3. `bindingRootIdx`
 * 4. `HostBindingsFunction` is passed in as is.
 *
 * The `HostBindingOpCodes` array contains:
 * - negative number to select the element index.
 * - followed by 1 or more of:
 *    - a number to select the directive index
 *    - a number to select the bindingRoot index
 *    - and a function to invoke.
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * ```
 * const hostBindingOpCodes = [
 *   ~30,                               // Select element 30
 *   40, 45, MyDir.ɵdir.hostBindings    // Invoke host bindings on MyDir on element 30;
 *                                      // directiveIdx = 40; bindingRootIdx = 45;
 *   50, 55, OtherDir.ɵdir.hostBindings // Invoke host bindings on OtherDire on element 30
 *                                      // directiveIdx = 50; bindingRootIdx = 55;
 * ]
 * ```
 *
 * ## Pseudocode
 * ```
 * const hostBindingOpCodes = tView.hostBindingOpCodes;
 * if (hostBindingOpCodes === null) return;
 * for (let i = 0; i < hostBindingOpCodes.length; i++) {
 *   const opCode = hostBindingOpCodes[i] as number;
 *   if (opCode < 0) {
 *     // Negative numbers are element indexes.
 *     setSelectedIndex(~opCode);
 *   } else {
 *     // Positive numbers are NumberTuple which store bindingRootIndex and directiveIndex.
 *     const directiveIdx = opCode;
 *     const bindingRootIndx = hostBindingOpCodes[++i] as number;
 *     const hostBindingFn = hostBindingOpCodes[++i] as HostBindingsFunction<any>;
 *     setBindingRootForHostBindings(bindingRootIndx, directiveIdx);
 *     const context = lView[directiveIdx];

/**
 * Stores DOM operations which need to be applied to update DOM render tree due to changes in

 *
 * The basic idea is that `i18nExp` OpCodes capture expression changes and update a change
 * mask bit. (Bit 1 for expression 1, bit 2 for expression 2 etc..., bit 32 for expression 32 and
 * higher.) The OpCodes then compare its own change mask against the expression change mask to
 * determine if the OpCodes should execute.
 *
 * NOTE: 32nd bit is special as it says 32nd or higher. This way if we have more than 32 bindings
 * the code still works, but with lower efficiency. (it is unlikely that a translation would have
 * more than 32 bindings.)
 *
 * These OpCodes can be used by both the i18n block as well as ICU sub-block.
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * Assume
 * ```ts
 *   if (rf & RenderFlags.Update) {
 *    i18nExp(ctx.exp1); // If changed set mask bit 1
 *    i18nExp(ctx.exp2); // If changed set mask bit 2
 *    i18nExp(ctx.exp3); // If changed set mask bit 3
 *    i18nExp(ctx.exp4); // If changed set mask bit 4
 *    i18nApply(0);            // Apply all changes by executing the OpCodes.
 *  }
 * ```
 * We can assume that each call to `i18nExp` sets an internal `changeMask` bit depending on the
 * index of `i18nExp`.
 *
 * ### OpCodes
 * ```ts
 * <I18nUpdateOpCodes>[
 *   // The following OpCodes represent: `<div i18n-title="pre{{exp1}}in{{exp2}}post">`
 *   // If `changeMask & 0b11`

    /**
     * Points to the declaration component view, used to track transplanted `LView`s.
     *
     * See: `DECLARATION_VIEW` which points to the actual `LView` where it was declared, whereas
     * `DECLARATION_COMPONENT_VIEW` points to the component which may not be same as
     * `DECLARATION_VIEW`.
     *
     * Example:
     * ```
     * <#VIEW #myComp>
     *  <div *ngIf="true">
     *   <ng-template #myTmpl>...</ng-template>
     *  </div>
     * </#VIEW>
     * ```
     * In the above case `DECLARATION_VIEW` for `myTmpl` points to the `LView` of `ngIf` whereas
     * `DECLARATION_COMPONENT_VIEW` points to `LView` of the `myComp` which owns the template.
     *
     * The reason for this is that all embedded views are always check-always whereas the component
     * view can be check-always or on-push. When we have a transplanted view it is important to
     * determine if we have transplanted a view from check-always declaration to on-push insertion
     * point. In such a case the transplanted view needs to be added to the `LContainer` in the
     * declared `LView` and CD during the declared view CD (in addition to the CD at the insertion
     * point.) (Any transplanted views which are intra Component are of no interest because the CD
     * strategy of declaration and insertion will always be the same, because it is the same
     * component.)
     *
     * Queries already track moved views in `LView[DECLARATION_LCONTAINER]` and
     * `LContainer[MOVED_VIEWS]`. However the queries also track `LView`s which moved within the same
     * component `LView`. Transplanted views are a subset of moved views, and we use
     * `DECLARATION_COMPONENT_VIEW` to differentiate them. As in this example.
     *
     * Example showing intra component `LView` movement.
     * ```
     * <#VIEW #myComp>
     *   <div *ngIf="condition; then thenBlock else elseBlock"></div>
     *   <ng-template #thenBlock>Content to render when condition is true.</ng-template>
     *   <ng-template #elseBlock>Content to render when condition is false.</ng-template>
     * </#VIEW>
     * ```
     * The `thenBlock` and `elseBlock` is moved but not transplanted.
     *
     * Example showing inter component `LView` movement (transplanted view).
     * ```
     * <#VIEW #myComp>
     *   <ng-template #myTmpl>...</ng-template>
     *   <insertion-component [template]="myTmpl"></insertion-component>
     * </#VIEW>
     * ```
     * In the above example `myTmpl` is passed into a different component. If `insertion-component`
     * instantiates `myTmpl` and `insertion-component` is on-push then the `LContainer` needs to be
     * marked as containing transplanted views and those views need to be CD as part of the
     * declaration CD.
     *
     *
     * When change detection runs, it iterates over `[MOVED_VIEWS]` and CDs any child `LView`s where
     * the `DECLARATION_COMPONENT_VIEW` of the current component and the child `LView` does not match
     * (it has been transplanted across components.)
     *
     * Note: `[DECLARATION_COMPONENT_VIEW]` points to itself if the LView is a component view (the
     *       simplest / most common case).
     *
     * see also:
     *   - https://hackmd.io/@mhevery/rJUJsvv9H write up of the problem

/**
 * A function optionally passed into the `NgForOf` directive to customize how `NgForOf` uniquely

 * when items in the iterable are reordered, new items are added, or existing items are removed.
 *
 *
 * In all of these scenarios it is usually desirable to only update the DOM elements associated
 * with the items affected by the change. This behavior is important to:
 *
 * - preserve any DOM-specific UI state (like cursor position, focus, text selection) when the
 *   iterable is modified
 * - enable animation of item addition, removal, and iterable reordering
 * - preserve the value of the `<select>` element when nested `<option>` elements are dynamically
 *   populated using `NgForOf` and the bound iterable is updated
 *
 * A common use for custom `trackBy` functions is when the model that `NgForOf` iterates over
 * contains a property with a unique identifier. For example, given a model:
 *
 * ```ts
 * class User {
 *   id: number;

 * a custom `trackBy` function could look like the following:

 * order so that we can re-concatenate the styling value in the desired priority.
 *
 * The insertion can happen either at the:
 * - end of template as in the case of coming across additional styling instruction in the template
 * - in front of the template in the case of coming across additional instruction in the
 *   `hostBindings`.
 *
 * We use `TStylingRange` to store the previous and next index into the `TData` where the template
 * bindings can be found.
 *
 * - bit 0 is used to mark that the previous index has a duplicate for current value.
 * - bit 1 is used to mark that the next index has a duplicate for the current value.
 * - bits 2-16 are used to encode the next/tail of the template.
 * - bits 17-32 are used to encode the previous/head of template.
 *
 * NODE: *duplicate* false implies that it is statically known that this binding will not collide
 * with other bindings and therefore there is no need to check other bindings. For example the
 * bindings in `<div [style.color]="exp" [style.width]="exp">` will never collide and will have
 * their bits set accordingly. Previous duplicate means that we may need to check previous if the
 * current binding is `null`. Next duplicate means that we may need to check next bindings if the
 * current binding is not `null`.
 *
 * NOTE: `0` has special significance and represents `null` as in no additional pointer.

/**
 * Store the static values for the styling binding.
 *
 * The `TStylingStatic` is just `KeyValueArray` where key `""` (stored at location 0) contains the
 * `TStylingKey` (stored at location 1). In other words this wraps the `TStylingKey` such that the
 * `""` contains the wrapped value.
 *
 * When instructions are resolving styling they may need to look forward or backwards in the linked
 * list to resolve the value. For this reason we have to make sure that he linked list also contains
 * the static values. However the list only has space for one item per styling instruction. For this
 * reason we store the static values here as part of the `TStylingKey`. This means that the
 * resolution function when looking for a value needs to first look at the binding value, and than
 * at `TStylingKey` (if it exists).
 *
 * Imagine we have:
 *
 * ```
 * <div class="TEMPLATE" my-dir>
 *
 * @Directive({
 *   host: {
 *     class: 'DIR',
 *     '[class.dynamic]': 'exp' // ɵɵclassProp('dynamic', ctx.exp);
 *   }
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * In the above case the linked list will contain one item:
 *
 * ```
 *   // assume binding location: 10 for `ɵɵclassProp('dynamic', ctx.exp);`
 *   tData[10] = <TStylingStatic>[
 *     '': 'dynamic', // This is the wrapped value of `TStylingKey`
 *     'DIR': true,   // This is the default static value of directive binding.
 *   ];
 *   tData[10 + 1] = 0; // We don't have prev/next.
 *
 *   lView[10] = undefined;     // assume `ctx.exp` is `undefined`
 *   lView[10 + 1] = undefined; // Just normalized `lView[10]`
 * ```
 *
 * So when the function is resolving styling value, it first needs to look into the linked list
 * (there is none) and than into the static `TStylingStatic` too see if there is a default value for
 * `dynamic` (there is not). Therefore it is safe to remove it.
 *
 * If setting `true` case:
 * ```
 *   lView[10] = true;     // assume `ctx.exp` is `true`
 *   lView[10 + 1] = true; // Just normalized `lView[10]`
 * ```
 * So when the function is resolving styling value, it first needs to look into the linked list
 * (there is none) and than into `TNode.residualClass` (TNode.residualStyle) which contains
 * ```
 *   tNode.residualClass = [
 *     'TEMPLATE': true,
 *   ];
 * ```
 *
 * This means that it is safe to add class.

     *
     * View queries are set before the `ngAfterViewInit` callback is called.
     *
     * **Metadata Properties**:
     *
     * * **selector** - The directive type or the name used for querying.
     * * **read** - Used to read a different token from the queried elements.
     * * **emitDistinctChangesOnly** - The ` QueryList#changes` observable will emit new values only
     *   if the QueryList result has changed. When `false` the `changes` observable might emit even
     *   if the QueryList has not changed.
     *   ** Note: *** This config option is **deprecated**, it will be permanently set to `true` and
     * removed in future versions of Angular.
     *
     * The following selectors are supported.
     *   * Any class with the `@Component` or `@Directive` decorator
     *   * A template reference variable as a string (e.g. query `<my-component #cmp></my-component>`
     * with `@ViewChildren('cmp')`)
     *   * Any provider defined in the child component tree of the current component (e.g.
     * `@ViewChildren(SomeService) someService!: SomeService`)
     *   * Any provider defined through a string token (e.g. `@ViewChildren('someToken')
     * someTokenVal!: any`)
     *   * A `TemplateRef` (e.g. query `<ng-template></ng-template>` with `@ViewChildren(TemplateRef)
     * template;`)
     *
     * In addition, multiple string selectors can be separated with a comma (e.g.
     * `@ViewChildren('cmp1,cmp2')`)
     *
     * The following values are supported by `read`:
     *   * Any class with the `@Component` or `@Directive` decorator
     *   * Any provider defined on the injector of the component that is matched by the `selector` of
     * this query
     *   * Any provider defined through a string token (e.g. `{provide: 'token', useValue: 'val'}`)
