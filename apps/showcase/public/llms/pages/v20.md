# Migration v20

Migration guide to PrimeNG v20.

## Backwardcompatible

Form Enhancements In this iteration, all form components have been reviewed and new demos for template-driven and reactive forms have been added. During this work, limitations have been identified and resolved as well. In addition, we've introduced a new property named invalid to the form components that you may use style a component as invalid. In previous versions, form components style themselves as invalid using a built-in style like the following. This style is opinionated as it is specifally for invalid and dirty states ignoring other potential UX requirements like touched/untouched or form submit. In v20, the new invalid provides full control to highlight a component a invalid. This styling change is backward compatible, meaning the opinionated ng-invalid.ng-dirty class is still included however in future versions, it will be removed. PrimeUIX Themes PrimeUIX is a shared package between all Prime libraries, this shared approach allows PrimeTek teams to share theming and the Design team who is responsible for the Figma UI Kit to work on a single design file, which is the single source of truth. Prior to v20, PrimeNG has its own fork in default styles and for the design tokens {{ '@' }}primeng/themes package is required. With v20, PrimeNG receives the styles from {{ '@' }}primeuix/styles under the hood and the design tokens as theme presets are loaded from {{ '@' }}primeuix/themes . The components need to be adjusted to fit in the PrimeUIX theming by using the host element where applicable, as a result for the components that use host element (&lt;p-* /&gt;) as their main container, the styleClass became obselete since native class attribute is already available on the custom element. Refer to the documentation of a particular component to find out if styleClass is deprecated. All of these changes are backward compatible, {{ '@' }}primeng/themes use {{ '@' }}primeuix/themes internally, and migration is easy as replacing the dependency {{ '@' }}primeng/themes with {{ '@' }}primeuix/themes in your application.

## Breaking

Our team has put in great deal of effort while updating PrimeNG, and there are no filed breaking changes in v20.

## Overview

PrimeNG v20 is an evolution rather than a revolution compared to v18/v19 that introduced the brand new theming architecture. V20 focuses on form enhancements along with the primeuix migration for shared theming between all Prime projects including PrimeVue, PrimeReact and the upcoming projects such as PrimeUI web components. As of v20, PrimeNG has switched PrimeNG to semantic versioning, and as a result changes are iterative, with a smooth migration strategy and no breaking changes. In the future versions, same approach will be put in action and migrations will be trivial with no breaking changes.
