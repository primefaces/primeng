# Installation

Setting up PrimeNG in an Angular CLI project.

## Download-

PrimeNG is available for download on the npm registry .

## Examples-

An example starter with Angular CLI is available at GitHub .

## Nextsteps-

Welcome to the Prime UI Ecosystem! Once you have PrimeNG up and running, we recommend exploring the following resources to gain a deeper understanding of the library. Global configuration Customization of styles Getting support

## Provider-

Add providePrimeNG and provideAnimationsAsync to the list of providers in your app.config.ts and use the theme property to configure a theme such as Aura.

<details>
<summary>TypeScript Example</summary>

```typescript
import { ApplicationConfig } from '@angular/core';
import { provideAnimationsAsync } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations/async';
import { providePrimeNG } from 'primeng/config';
import Aura from '@primeuix/themes/aura';

export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
    providers: [
        provideAnimationsAsync(),
        providePrimeNG({
            theme: {
                preset: Aura
            }
        })
    ]
};
```
</details>

## Theme-

Configure PrimeNG to use a theme like Aura.

<details>
<summary>TypeScript Example</summary>

```typescript
import { ApplicationConfig } from '@angular/core';
import { provideAnimationsAsync } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations/async';
import { providePrimeNG } from 'primeng/config';
import Aura from '@primeng/themes/aura';

export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
    providers: [
        provideAnimationsAsync(),
        providePrimeNG({
            theme: Aura
        })
    ]
};
```
</details>

## Verify-

Verify your setup by adding a component such as Button. Each component can be imported and registered individually so that you only include what you use for bundle optimization. Import path is available in the documentation of the corresponding component.

## Videos

Angular CLI is the recommended way to build Angular applications with PrimeNG.

# Configuration

Application wide configuration for PrimeNG.

## Csp-

The nonce value to use on dynamically generated style elements in core.

<details>
<summary>TypeScript Example</summary>

```typescript
providePrimeNG({ 
    csp: {
        nonce: '...'
    }
})
```
</details>

## Dynamic-

Inject the PrimeNG to your application to update the initial configuration at runtime.

<details>
<summary>TypeScript Example</summary>

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { PrimeNG } from 'primeng/config';

@Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    templateUrl: './app.component.html'
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {

    constructor(private primeng: PrimeNG) {}

    ngOnInit() {
        this.primeng.ripple.set(true);
    }
}
```
</details>

## Filtermode-

Default filter modes to display on DataTable filter menus.

<details>
<summary>TypeScript Example</summary>

```typescript
import { PrimeNGConfig } from 'primeng/api';

@Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    templateUrl: './app.component.html'
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {

    constructor(private primengConfig: PrimeNGConfig) {}

    ngOnInit() {
        primengConfig.filterMatchModeOptions = {
            text: [FilterMatchMode.STARTS_WITH, FilterMatchMode.CONTAINS, FilterMatchMode.NOT_CONTAINS, FilterMatchMode.ENDS_WITH, FilterMatchMode.EQUALS, FilterMatchMode.NOT_EQUALS],
            numeric: [FilterMatchMode.EQUALS, FilterMatchMode.NOT_EQUALS, FilterMatchMode.LESS_THAN, FilterMatchMode.LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL_TO, FilterMatchMode.GREATER_THAN, FilterMatchMode.GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL_TO],
            date: [FilterMatchMode.DATE_IS, FilterMatchMode.DATE_IS_NOT, FilterMatchMode.DATE_BEFORE, FilterMatchMode.DATE_AFTER]
        };
    }
}
```
</details>

## Inputvariant-

Input fields come in two styles, default is outlined with borders around the field whereas filled alternative adds a background color to the field. A theme such as Material may add more additional design changes per each variant.

## Api

Locale Options

## Repository

Ready to use settings for locales are available at the community supported PrimeLocale repository. We'd appreciate if you could contribute to this repository with pull requests and share it with the rest of the community.

## Runtime

The translations can be changed dynamically at runtime, here is an example with ngx-translate.

<details>
<summary>TypeScript Example</summary>

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { PrimeNG } from 'primeng/config';
import { TranslateService } from '@ngx-translate/core';

@Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    templateUrl: './app.component.html'
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {

    constructor(private config: PrimeNG, private translateService: TranslateService) {}

    ngOnInit() {
        this.translateService.setDefaultLang('en');
    }

    translate(lang: string) {
        this.translateService.use(lang);
        this.translateService.get('primeng').subscribe(res => this.primeng.setTranslation(res));
    }
}
```
</details>

## Translation

A translation is specified using the translation property during initialization.

<details>
<summary>TypeScript Example</summary>

```typescript
providePrimeNG({ 
    translation: {
        accept: 'Aceptar',
        reject: 'Rechazar',
        //translations
    }
})
```
</details>

## Overlayappendto-

Defines the default location of the overlays; self refers to the host element and body targets the document body. Defaults to self .

## Provider-

The initial configuration is defined by the providePrimeNG provider during application startup.

<details>
<summary>TypeScript Example</summary>

```typescript
import { ApplicationConfig } from '@angular/core';
import { provideAnimationsAsync } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations/async';
import { providePrimeNG } from 'primeng/config';

export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
    providers: [
        provideAnimationsAsync(),
        providePrimeNG({ /* options */ })
    ]
};
```
</details>

## Ripple-

Ripple is an optional animation for the supported components such as buttons. It is disabled by default.

<details>
<summary>TypeScript Example</summary>

```typescript
providePrimeNG({ 
    ripple: true
})
```
</details>

## Theme-

PrimeNG provides 4 predefined themes out of the box; Aura, Material, Lara and Nora. See the theming documentation for details.

<details>
<summary>TypeScript Example</summary>

```typescript
import { ApplicationConfig } from '@angular/core';
import { provideAnimationsAsync } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations/async';
import { providePrimeNG } from 'primeng/config';

import Aura from '@primeng/themes/aura';

export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
    providers: [
        provideAnimationsAsync(),
        providePrimeNG({
            theme: {
                preset: Aura,
                options: {
                    prefix: 'p',
                    darkModeSelector: 'system',
                    cssLayer: false
                }
            }
        })
    ]
};
```
</details>

## Zindex-

ZIndexes are managed automatically to make sure layering of overlay components work seamlessly when combining multiple components. Still there may be cases where you'd like to configure the configure default values such as a custom layout where header section is fixed. In a case like this, dropdown needs to be displayed below the application header but a modal dialog should be displayed above. PrimeNG configuration offers the zIndex property to customize the default values for components categories. Default values are described below and can be customized when setting up PrimeNG.

<details>
<summary>TypeScript Example</summary>

```typescript
import { PrimeNGConfig } from 'primeng/api';

@Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    templateUrl: './app.component.html'
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {

    constructor(private primengConfig: PrimeNGConfig) {}

    ngOnInit() {
        this.primengConfig.zIndex = {
            modal: 1100,    // dialog, sidebar
            overlay: 1000,  // dropdown, overlaypanel
            menu: 1000,     // overlay menus
            tooltip: 1100   // tooltip
        };
    }
}
```
</details>

# Styled Mode

Choose from a variety of pre-styled themes or develop your own.

## Architecture-

PrimeNG is a design agnostic library so unlike some other UI libraries it does not enforce a certain styling such as material design. Styling is decoupled from the components using the themes instead. A theme consists of two parts; base and preset . The base is the style rules with CSS variables as placeholders whereas the preset is a set of design tokens to feed a base by mapping the tokens to CSS variables. A base may be configured with different presets, currently Aura, Material, Lara and Nora are the available built-in options. The core of the styled mode architecture is based on a concept named design token , a preset defines the token configuration in 3 tiers; primitive , semantic and component . Primitive Tokens Primitive tokens have no context, a color palette is a good example for a primitive token such as blue-50 to blue-900 . A token named blue-500 may be used as the primary color, the background of a message however on its own, the name of the token does not indicate context. Usually they are utilized by the semantic tokens. Semantic Tokens Semantic tokens define content and their names indicate where they are utilized, a well known example of a semantic token is the primary.color . Semantic tokens map to primitive tokens or other semantic tokens. The colorScheme token group is a special variable to define tokens based on the color scheme active in the application, this allows defining different tokens based on the color scheme like dark mode. Component Tokens Component tokens are isolated tokens per component such as inputtext.background or button.color that map to the semantic tokens. As an example, button.background component token maps to the primary.color semantic token which maps to the green.500 primitive token. Best Practices Use primitive tokens when defining the core color palette and semantic tokens to specify the common design elements such as focus ring, primary colors and surfaces. Components tokens should only be used when customizing a specific component. By defining your own design tokens as a custom preset, you'll be able to define your own style without touching CSS. Overriding the PrimeNG components using style classes is not a best practice and should be the last resort, design tokens are the suggested approach.

## Bootstrap-

Bootstrap has a reboot utility to reset the CSS of the standard elements. If you are including this utility, you may give it a layer while importing it.

## Colors-

Color palette of a preset is defined by the primitive design token group. You can access colors using CSS variables or the $dt utility. @for (color of colors; track color) { {{ color }} @for (shade of shades; track shade) { {{ shade }} } }

## Colorscheme-

A token can be defined per color scheme using light and dark properties of the colorScheme property. Each token can have specific values based on the current color scheme. Common Pitfall When customizing an existing preset, your token overrides may be ignored if you don't properly account for color scheme variations. If the original preset defines a token using the colorScheme property, but your customization only provides a direct value, your override will be ignored because the colorScheme property takes precedence over direct values and the system will continue using the preset's scheme-specific values. When customizing tokens that are not defined with colorScheme in the original preset, your customizations will be applied successfully regardless of how you structure them; whether direct or under colorScheme. Best Practices Check how tokens are defined in the preset before customizing from the source . Always maintain the same structure (direct value or colorScheme) as the original preset. Consider both light and dark mode values when overriding scheme-dependent tokens. This approach ensures your customizations will be applied correctly regardless of the user's selected color scheme.

## Component-

The design tokens of a specific component is defined at components layer. Overriding components tokens is not the recommended approach if you are building your own style, building your own preset should be preferred instead. This configuration is global and applies to all card components, in case you need to customize a particular component on a page locally, view the Scoped CSS section for an example.

## Darkmode-

PrimeNG uses the system as the default darkModeSelector in theme configuration. If you have a dark mode switch in your application, set the darkModeSelector to the selector you utilize such as .my-app-dark so that PrimeNG can fit in seamlessly with your color scheme. Following is a very basic example implementation of a dark mode switch, you may extend it further by involving prefers-color-scheme to retrieve it from the system initially and use localStorage to make it stateful. See this article for more information. In case you prefer to use dark mode all the time, apply the darkModeSelector initially and never change it. It is also possible to disable dark mode completely using false or none as the value of the selector.

## Definepreset-

The definePreset utility is used to customize an existing preset during the PrimeNG setup. The first parameter is the preset to customize and the second is the design tokens to override.

## Dt-

The $dt function returns the information about a token like the full path and value. This would be useful if you need to access tokens programmatically.

## Extend-

The theming system can be extended by adding custom design tokens and additional styles. This feature provides a high degree of customization, allowing you to adjust styles according to your needs, as you are not limited to the default tokens. The example preset configuration adds a new accent button with custom button.accent.color and button.accent.inverse.color tokens. It is also possible to add tokens globally to share them within the components.

## Focusring-

Focus ring defines the outline width, style, color and offset. Let's use a thicker ring with the primary color for the outline.

## Font-

There is no design for fonts as UI components inherit their font settings from the application.

## Forms-

The design tokens of the form input components are derived from the form.field token group. This customization example changes border color to primary on hover. Any component that depends on this semantic token such as dropdown.hover.border.color and textarea.hover.border.color would receive the change.

## Libraries-

Example layer configuration for the popular CSS libraries.

## Noir-

The noir mode is the nickname of a variant that uses surface tones as the primary and requires and additional colorScheme configuration to implement. A sample preset configuration with black and white variants as the primary color;

## Options-

The options property defines the how the CSS would be generated from the design tokens of the preset. prefix The prefix of the CSS variables, defaults to p . For instance, the primary.color design token would be var(--p-primary-color) . darkModeSelector The CSS rule to encapsulate the CSS variables of the dark mode, the default is the system to generate {{ '@' }}media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) . If you need to make the dark mode toggleable based on the user selection define a class selector such as .app-dark and toggle this class at the document root. See the dark mode toggle section for an example. cssLayer Defines whether the styles should be defined inside a CSS layer by default or not. A CSS layer would be handy to declare a custom cascade layer for easier customization if necessary. The default is false .

## Palette-

Returns shades and tints of a given color from 50 to 950 as an array.

## Presets-

Aura, Material, Lara and Nora are the available built-in options, created to demonstrate the power of the design-agnostic theming. Aura is PrimeTek's own vision, Material follows Google Material Design v2, Lara is based on Bootstrap and Nora is inspired by enterprise applications. Visit the source code to learn more about the structure of presets. You may use them out of the box with modifications or utilize them as reference in case you need to build your own presets from scratch.

## Primary-

The primary defines the main color palette, default value maps to the emerald primitive token. Let's setup to use indigo instead.

## Reset-

In case PrimeNG components have visual issues in your application, a Reset CSS may be the culprit. CSS layers would be an efficient solution that involves enabling the PrimeNG layer, wrapping the Reset CSS in another layer and defining the layer order. This way, your Reset CSS does not get in the way of PrimeNG components.

## Scale-

PrimeNG UI component use rem units, 1rem equals to the font size of the html element which is 16px by default. Use the root font-size to adjust the size of the components globally. This website uses 14px as the base so it may differ from your application if your base font size is different.

## Scopedtokens-

Design tokens can be scoped to a certain component using the dt property. In this example, first switch uses the global tokens whereas second one overrides the global with its own tokens. This approach is recommended over the ::ng-deep as it offers a cleaner API while avoiding the hassle of CSS rule overrides.

## Specificity-

The &#64;layer is a standard CSS feature to define cascade layers for a customizable order of precedence. If you need to become more familiar with layers, visit the documentation at MDN to begin with. The cssLayer is disabled by default, when it is enabled at theme configuration, PrimeNG wraps the built-in style classes under the primeng cascade layer to make the library styles easy to override. CSS in your app without a layer has the highest CSS specificity, so you'll be able to override styles regardless of the location or how strong a class is written.

## Surface-

The color scheme palette that varies between light and dark modes is specified with the surface tokens. Example below uses zinc for light mode and slategray for dark mode. With this setting, light mode, would have a grayscale tone and dark mode would include bluish tone.

## Tailwind-

Tailwind CSS includes a reset utility in base called preflight . If you are using this feature, wrap the base and utilities in separate layers and make sure primeng layer comes after the base.

## Theme-

The theme property is used to customize the initial theme.

<details>
<summary>TypeScript Example</summary>

```typescript
import { ApplicationConfig } from '@angular/core';
import { providePrimeNG } from 'primeng/config';
import Aura from '@primeuix/themes/aura';

export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
    providers: [
        providePrimeNG({
            theme: {
                preset: Aura
            }
        })
    ]
};
```
</details>

## Updatepreset-

Merges the provided tokens to the current preset, an example would be changing the primary color palette dynamically.

## Updateprimarypalette-

Updates the primary colors, this is a shorthand to do the same update using updatePreset .

## Updatesurfacepalette-

Updates the surface colors, this is a shorthand to do the same update using updatePreset .

## Usepreset-

Replaces the current presets entirely, common use case is changing the preset dynamically at runtime.

# Unstyled Mode

Theming PrimeNG with alternative styling approaches.

## Architecture-

The term unstyled is used to define an alternative styling approach instead of the default theming with design tokens. In unstyled mode the css variables of the design tokens and the css rule sets that utilize them are not included. Here is an example of an Unstyled Select, the core functionality and accessibility is provided whereas styling is not included.

## Example-

Unstyled components require styling using your preferred approach. We recommend using Tailwind CSS with PassThrough attributes, a combination that works seamlessly together. The tailwindcss-primeui even provides special variants such as p-outlined: , p-vertical for the PrimeNG components. The example below demonstrates how to style a button component with Tailwind CSS using PassThrough attributes. Before you begin, refer to the pass through section in the button documentation to familiarize yourself with the component's internal structure and PassThrough attributes. In this example, we'll target the root , label and icon elements to apply custom styles.

```html
<p-button
    label="Search"
    icon="pi pi-search"
    [unstyled]="true"
    [pt]="{ 
        root: 'bg-teal-500 hover:bg-teal-700 active:bg-teal-900 cursor-pointer py-2 px-4 rounded-full border-0 flex gap-2', 
        label: 'text-white font-bold text-lg', 
        icon: 'text-white !text-xl' 
    }"
/>
```

## Global-

A global configuration can be created at application level to avoid repetition via the global pt option so that the styles can be shared from a single location. A particular component can still override a global configuration with its own pt property.

<details>
<summary>TypeScript Example</summary>

```typescript
import { ApplicationConfig } from '@angular/core';

export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
    providers: [
        providePrimeNG({
            unstyled: true,
            pt: {
                button: {
                    root: 'bg-teal-500 hover:bg-teal-700 active:bg-teal-900 cursor-pointer py-2 px-4 rounded-full border-0 flex gap-2',
                    label: 'text-white font-bold text-lg',
                    icon: 'text-white !text-xl'
                }
            }
        })
    ]
};
```
</details>

## Setup-

Unstyled mode is enabled for the whole suite by enabling unstyled option during PrimeNG installation. Alternatively even in the default styled mode, a particular component can still be used as unstyled by adding the unstyled prop of the component.

## Voltui-

Tailwind CSS is perfect fit for the unstyled mode, PrimeTek has even initiated a new UI library called Volt UI based on the unstyled PrimeVue and Tailwind CSS v4. Volt follows the code ownership model where the components are located in the application codebase rather than node_modules. All components within Volt are essentially wrapped versions of the unstyled equivalents, with an added layer of theming through Tailwind CSS v4. This approach, along with the templating features, offers complete control over the theming and presentation. Volt will also be available for PrimeReact. In the future, PrimeTek may bring Volt to Angular via PrimeNG if there is significant community demand. Currently, Volt-Vue can serve as a reference when styling your unstyled PrimeNG components with Tailwind CSS.

# Icons

PrimeIcons is the default icon library of PrimeNG with over 250 open source icons.

## Basic-

PrimeIcons use the pi pi-&#123;icon&#125; syntax such as pi pi-check . A standalone icon can be displayed using an element such as i or span

```html
<i class="pi pi-check"></i>
<i class="pi pi-times"></i>
<span class="pi pi-search"></span>
<span class="pi pi-user"></span>
```

## Color-

Icon color is defined with the color property which is inherited from parent by default.

```html
<i class="pi pi-check" style="color: slateblue"></i>
<i class="pi pi-times" style="color: green"></i>
<i class="pi pi-search" style="color: var(--primary-color)"></i>
<i class="pi pi-user" style="color: #708090"></i>
```

## Constants-

Constants API is available to reference icons easily when used programmatically.

<details>
<summary>TypeScript Example</summary>

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { PrimeIcons, MenuItem } from 'primeng/api';

@Component({
    selector: 'prime-icons-constants-demo',
    templateUrl: './prime-icons-constants-demo.html'
})
export class PrimeIconsConstantsDemo {
    items: MenuItem[];

    ngOnInit() {
        this.items = [
            {
                label: 'New',
                icon: PrimeIcons.PLUS,
            },
            {
                label: 'Delete',
                icon: PrimeIcons.TRASH
            }
        ];
    }
}
```
</details>

## Download-

PrimeIcons is available at npm, run the following command to download it to your project.

## Figma-

PrimeIcons library is now available on Figma Community . By adding them as a library, you can easily use these icons in your designs.

## Import-

CSS file of the icon library needs to be imported in styles.scss of your application.

## List-

Here is the full list of PrimeIcons. More icons will be added periodically and you may also request new icons at the issue tracker.

## Size-

Size of an icon is controlled with the font-size property of the element.

```html
<i class="pi pi-check" style="font-size: 1rem"></i>
<i class="pi pi-times" style="font-size: 1.5rem"></i>
<i class="pi pi-search" style="font-size: 2rem"></i>
<i class="pi pi-user" style="font-size: 2.5rem"></i>
```

## Spin-

Special pi-spin class applies infinite rotation to an icon.

```html
<i class="pi pi-spin pi-spinner" style="font-size: 2rem"></i>
<i class="pi pi-spin pi-cog" style="font-size: 2rem"></i>
```

# Pass Through

Pass Through Props allow direct access to the underlying elements for complete customization.

## Basic-

Each component has a special pt property to define an object with keys corresponding to the available DOM elements. Each value can either be a string, an object or a function that returns a string or an object to define the arbitrary properties to apply to the element such as styling, aria, data-* or custom attributes. If the value is a string or a function that returns a string, it is considered as a class definition and added to the class attribute of the element. Every component documentation has a dedicated section to document the available section names exposed via PT.

## Global-

PassThrough object can also be defined at a global level to apply all components in an application using the providePrimeNG provider. For example, with the configuration here all panel headers have the bg-primary style class and all autocomplete components have a fixed width. These settings can be overridden by a particular component as components pt property has higher precedence over global pt by default.

## Instance-

In cases where you need to access the UI Component instance, define a component passthrough type that exposes the component instance or a function that receives a PassThroughContext as parameter.

## Introduction-

In traditional 3rd party UI libraries, users are limited to the API provided by component author. This API commonly consists of inputs, outputs, and content projection. Whenever a requirement emerges for a new customization option in the API, the component author needs to develop and publish it with a new release. Vision of PrimeTek is "Your Components, Not Ours" . The pass through feature is a key element to implement this vision by exposing the component internals in order to apply arbitrary attributes and listeners to the DOM elements. The primary advantage of this approach is that it frees you from being restricted by the main component API. We recommend considering the pass-through feature whenever you need to tailor a component that lacks a built-in feature for your specific requirement. Each component has a special pt property to define an object with keys corresponding to the available DOM elements. A value of a key can either be a string, an object or a function to define the arbitrary properties such as styling, aria, data-* or custom attributes for the element. If the value is a string or a function that returns a string, it serves as a shorthand for a style class definition. Every component documentation has a dedicated segment to document the available section names in the interactive PT Viewer. Panel Example In this example, a Panel is customized with various options through pt . The styling is overriden with Tailwind CSS and header receives custom attributes along with a click event. The attributes passed to the header are not available in the component API, thanks to PassThrough feature, this is no longer an issue as you are not limited to the component api. Note that, you may avoid the ! based overrides in Tailwind classes if you setup CSS Layers with PrimeNG. Visit the Override section at Tailwind integration for examples.

## Lifecycle-

Lifecycle hooks of components are exposed as pass through using the hooks property so that callback functions can be registered. Available callbacks are onBeforeInit , onInit , onChanges , onDoCheck , onAfterContentInit , onAfterContentChecked , onAfterViewInit , onAfterViewChecked and onDestroy . Refer to the Angular documentation for detailed information about lifecycle hooks.

## Pcprefix-

A UI component may also use other UI components, in this case section names are prefixed with pc (Prime Component) to denote the PrimeNG component begin used. This distinguishes components from standard DOM elements and indicating the necessity for a nested structure. For example, the badge section is identified as pcBadge because the button component incorporates the badge component internally.

## Ptoptions-

The ⁠ptOptions property determines how a component's local PassThrough configuration merges with the global PT configuration, as demonstrated in the following examples using both global and component-level settings. The mergeSections defines whether the sections from the main configuration gets added and the mergeProps controls whether to override or merge the defined props. Defaults are true for mergeSections and false for mergeProps . Global Configuration mergeSections: true, mergeProps: false (default) mergeSections: true, mergeProps: true mergeSections: false, mergeProps: true mergeSections: false, mergeProps: false

# Tailwind CSS

Integration between PrimeNG and Tailwind CSS.

## Animations-

The plugin also adds extended animation utilities that can be used with the styleclass and animateonscroll directives.

```html
<p-select [(ngModel)]="animation" [options]="animations" placeholder="Select One" class="w-full sm:w-44" />
<div class="py-8 overflow-hidden">
   <div [ngClass]="dynamicAnimationClasses"></div>
</div>
```

## Colorpalette-

PrimeNG color palette as utility classes.

## Darkmode-

In styled mode, PrimeNG uses the system as the default darkModeSelector in theme configuration. If you have a dark mode switch in your application, ensure that darkModeSelector is aligned with the Tailwind dark variant for seamless integration. Note that, this particular configuration isn't required if you're utilizing the default system color scheme. Suppose that, the darkModeSelector is set as my-app-dark in PrimeNG. Tailwind v4 Add a custom variant for dark with a custom selector. Tailwind v3 Use the plugins option in your Tailwind config file to configure the plugin.

## Extensions-

The plugin extends the default configuration with a new set of utilities. All variants and breakpoints are supported e.g. dark:sm:hover:bg-primary . Color Palette Class Property primary-[50-950] Primary color palette. surface-[0-950] Surface color palette. primary Default primary color. primary-contrast Default primary contrast color. primary-emphasis Default primary emphasis color. border-surface Default primary emphasis color. bg-emphasis Emphasis background e.g. hovered element. bg-highlight Highlight background. bg-highlight-emphasis Highlight background with emphasis. rounded-border Border radius. text-color Text color with emphasis. text-color-emphasis Default primary emphasis color. text-muted-color Secondary text color. text-muted-color-emphasis Secondary text color with emphasis.

## Form-

Using Tailwind utilities for the responsive layout of a form with PrimeNG components.

```html
<div class="flex flex-col gap-6 w-full sm:w-auto">
    <div class="flex flex-col sm:flex-row sm:items-center gap-6">

## Override-

In styled mode, Tailwind utilities may not be able to override the default styling due to css specificity, there are two possible solutions. Important Use the ! as a prefix to enforce the styling. CSS Layer Enable PrimeNG CSS layer and configure the tailwind styles to have higher specificity with layering. This way, ! prefix is not required.

## Overview-

Tailwind CSS is a popular CSS framework based on a utility-first design. The core provides flexible CSS classes with predefined CSS rules to build your own UI elements. For example, instead of an opinionated btn class as in Bootstrap, Tailwind offers primitive classes like bg-blue-500 , rounded and p-4 to apply a button. A set of reusable classes can also be grouped as a Tailwind CSS component and there are even a couple of libraries that take this approach to build components specifically for Tailwind. Tailwind is an outstanding CSS library, however it lacks a true comprehensive UI suite when combined with Angular, this is where PrimeNG comes in by providing a wide range of highly accessible and feature rich UI component library. The core of PrimeNG does not depend on Tailwind CSS.

## Plugin-

The tailwindcss-primeui is an official plugin by PrimeTek to provide first class integration between a Prime UI library like PrimeNG and Tailwind CSS. It is designed to work both in styled and unstyled modes. In styled mode, for instance the semantic colors such as primary and surfaces are provided as Tailwind utilities e.g. bg-primary , text-surface-500 , text-muted-color . Plugin is available on npm. After installation, configure the plugin at your tailwind configuration file.

PrimeNG has WCAG 2.1 AA level compliance.

## Colors-

Colors on a web page should aim a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 and consider a selection of colors that do not cause vibration. Good Contrast Color contrast between the background and the foreground content should be sufficient enough to ensure readability. Example below displays two cases with good and bad samples. GOOD BAD Vibration Color vibration is leads to an illusion of motion due to choosing colors that have low visibility against each other. Color combinations need to be picked with caution to avoid vibration. VIBRATE Dark Mode Highly saturated colors should be avoided when used within a dark design scheme as they cause eye strain. Instead desaturated colors should be preferred. Indigo 500 Indigo 200

## Formcontrols-

Native form elements should be preferred instead of elements that are meant for other purposes like presentation. As an example, button below is rendered as a form control by the browser, can receive focus via tabbing and can be used with space key as well to trigger. On the other hand, a fancy css based button using a div has no keyboard or screen reader support. tabindex is required to make a div element accessible in addition to use a keydown to bring the keyboard support back. To avoid the overload and implementing functionality that is already provided by the browser, native form controls should be preferred. Relations Form components must be related to another element that describes what the form element is used for. This is usually achieved with the label element.

## Introduction-

According to the World Health Organization, 15% of the world population has a disability to some degree. As a result, accessibility features in any context such as a ramp for wheelchair users or a multimedia with captions are crucial to ensure content can be consumed by anyone. Disabilities Types of disabilities are diverse so you need to know your audience well and how they interact with the content created. There four main categories; Visual Impairments Blindness, low-level vision or color blindness are the common types of visual impairments. Screen magnifiers and the color blind mode are usually built-in features of the browsers whereas for people who rely on screen readers, page developers are required to make sure content is readable by the readers. Popular readers are NVDA , JAWS and ChromeVox . Hearing Impairments Deafness or hearing loss refers to the inability to hear sounds totally or partially. People with hearing impairments use assistive devices however it may not be enough when interacting with a web page. Common implementation is providing textual alternatives, transcripts and captions for content with audio. Mobility Impairments People with mobility impairments have disabilities related to movement due to loss of a limb, paralysis or other varying reasons. Assistive technologies like a head pointer is a device to interact with a screen whereas keyboard or a trackpad remain as solutions for people who are not able to utilize a mouse. Cognitive Impairments Cognitive impairments have a wider range that includes people with learning disabilities, depression and dyslexia. A well designed content also leads to better user experience for people without disabilities so designing for cognitive impairments result in better design for any user.

## Semantichtml-

HTML offers various element to organize content on a web page that screen readers are aware of. Preferring Semantic HTML for good semantics provide out of the box support for reader which is not possible when regular div elements with classes are used. Consider the following example that do not mean too much for readers. Same layout can be achieved using the semantic elements with screen reader support built-in.

## Waiaria-

ARIA refers to "Accessible Rich Internet Applications" is a suite to fill the gap where semantic HTML is inadequate. These cases are mainly related to rich UI components/widgets. Although browser support for rich UI components such as a datepicker or colorpicker has been improved over the past years many web developers still utilize UI components derived from standard HTML elements created by them or by other projects like PrimeNG. These types of components must provide keyboard and screen reader support, the latter case is where the WAI-ARIA is utilized. ARIA consists of roles, properties and attributes. Roles define what the element is mainly used for e.g. checkbox , dialog , tablist whereas States and Properties define the metadata of the element like aria-checked , aria-disabled . Consider the following case of a native checkbox. It has built-in keyboard and screen reader support. A fancy checkbox with css animations might look more appealing but accessibility might be lacking. Checkbox below may display a checked font icon with animations however it is not tabbable, cannot be checked with space key and cannot be read by a reader. One alternative is using ARIA roles for readers and use javascript for keyboard support. Notice the usage of aria-labelledby as a replacement of the label tag with for. However the best practice is combining semantic HTML for accessibility while keeping the design for UX. This approach involves hiding a native checkbox for accessibility and using javascript events to update its state. Notice the usage of p-sr-only that hides the elements from the user but not from the screen reader. A working sample is the PrimeNG checkbox that is tabbable, keyboard accessible and is compliant with a screen reader. Instead of ARIA roles it relies on a hidden native checkbox. Remember Me

## Wcag-

WCAG refers to Web Content Accessibility Guideline , a standard managed by the WAI (Web Accessibility Initiative) of W3C (World Wide Web Consortium). WCAG consists of recommendations for making the web content more accessible. PrimeNG components aim high level of WCAG compliancy in the near future. Various countries around the globe have governmental policies regarding web accessibility as well. Most well known of these are Section 508 in the US and Web Accessibility Directive of the European Union.

# Animations

Built-in CSS animations for PrimeNG components.

## Anchoredoverlays-

Anchored overlays are the components that have a floating ui positioned relatively to another element such as Select, Popover. The enter and leave animations are defined with the .p-anchored-overlay-enter-active and .p-anchored-overlay-leave-active classes.

## Collapsibles-

Collapsible components have a content that is toggleable including Accordion, Panel, Fieldset, Stepper and PanelMenu. The enter and leave animations are defined with the .p-collapsible-enter-active and .p-collapsible-leave-active classes. Header I Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum. Header II Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo. Nemo enim ipsam voluptatem quia voluptas sit aspernatur aut odit aut fugit, sed quia consequuntur magni dolores eos qui ratione voluptatem sequi nesciunt. Consectetur, adipisci velit, sed quia non numquam eius modi. Header III Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo. Nemo enim ipsam voluptatem quia voluptas sit aspernatur aut odit aut fugit, sed quia consequuntur magni dolores eos qui ratione voluptatem sequi nesciunt. Consectetur, adipisci velit, sed quia non numquam eius modi.

## Dialog-

Overlays such as Dialog and Drawer are positioned relative to the viewport and have their own animations. Update your information. Username Email

## Disable-

Individual animations can be reduced and even disabled completely using the animation duration.

## Introduction-

Various PrimeNG Components utilize native CSS animations to provide an enhanced user experience. The default animations are based on the best practices recommended by the usability experts. In case you need to customize the default animations, this documentation covers the entire set of built-in animations. Animations are defined using a combination of style classes and keyframes. The ⁠ .&#123;classname&#125;-enter-active and ⁠ .&#123;classname&#125;-leave-active classes specify the animation name, duration, and easing function. You can customize animations globally by overriding the default animation classes, affecting all components. Alternatively, you can apply scoped classes to individual components to modify their animations independently. For demo purposes, this second approach is used throughout the next sections.

## Reference-

# RTL

Right-to-left support for PrimeNG components.

## Configuration-

The PrimeNG components natively support Right-to-Left (RTL) text direction through a modern CSS implementation utilizing FlexBox and classes like *-inline-start and *-block-end . Consequently, no JavaScript configuration is necessary; setting the document's text direction to RTL is sufficient to enable this feature. The RTL setting can either be set using the dir attribute or with the direction style property.

## Limitations-

RTL is widely supported by the UI suite except the Galleria and Carousel components. These components will be enhanced with a modern implementation in upcoming versions with built-in support for RTL.

# Migration v19

Migration guide to PrimeNG v19.

## Breakingchanges

Configuration The PrimeNGConfig has been replaced by PrimeNG and the initial configuration is now done via the providePrimeNG provider during startup. See the installation section for an example. SASS Themes The styled mode theming has been reimplemented from scratch based on an all-new architecture. The theme.css and the primeng/resources do not exist anymore, so any imports of these assets needs to be removed. If you had a custom theme for v17, the theme needs to be recreated using the new APIs. See the customization section at styled mode for details. Removed Components TriStateCheckbox | Use Checkbox with indeterminate option. DataViewLayoutOptions | Use SelectButton instead. pAnimate | Use pAnimateOnScroll instead. Removed Files Themes under the primeng/resources path, migration to new styled mode is necessary. Messages and Message Messages component is deprecated due to unnecessary role of being just a wrapper around multiple message instances and it's replaced with the new Message . Instead of message, users now need to loop through their custom array to display multiple messages to achieve same behavior. The spacing, closable and life properties of the Message have breaking changes to provide Message functionality. Default margin is removed, closable is false by default and messages do not disappear automatically. Message Interface Message interface in primeng/api is renamed as ToastMessageOptions due to name collision with the Message component. Removed Features Sidebar/Drawer size property is removed, use a responsive class utilty as replacement, demos have new examples. Removed Style Classes .p-link , use a button in link mode. .p-highlight , each component have its own class such as .p-select-option-selected . .p-fluid , use the new built-in fluid property of the supported components or the Fluid component. PrimeFlex CSS In case you are using PrimeFlex CSS library, upgrade to PrimeFlex v4 since PrimeFlex v3 is not compatible with PrimeNG v18+

## Deprecatedcomponents

Deprecated Components Components that are deprecated since their functionality is provided by other components. Chips | Use AutoComplete with multiple enabled and typeahead disabled. TabMenu | Use Tabs without panels. Steps | Use Stepper without panels. InlineMessage | Use Message component. TabView | Use the new Tabs components. Accordion | Use with the new AccordionHeader and AccordionContent components. Messages | Use with the new Message component. pDefer | Use Angular defer instead.

## Migrationoverview

At PrimeTek, we have been developing UI component libraries since 2008. The web continues to undergo technological advancements, and as a result, we have to modernize and update our libraries to stay relevant. PrimeNG v18 is the next-generation version that fully embraces modern Web APIs and removes technical debt like the legacy-styled mode. Every component has been reviewed and enhanced. The most notable feature is the new styled mode implementation. Previous iterations use SASS at an external repo called PrimeNG-sass-theme which requires compilation of a theme.css a file. This file had to be included in the application and need to be swapped at runtime for basic tasks like dark mode or primary color changes. In v18, styled mode is now part of the core, SASS is not used at all, and a new design token based architecture that fully utilizes CSS variables has been created. The new API is modern and superior to the legacy styled mode. Names of some of the components have been changed to more common alternatives for example, Popover replaced OverlayPanel and InputSwitch is now called ToggleSwitch . Each component has been reviewed for a consistent naming between CSS class names and sections. An example would be the option element of a Select component that uses p-select-option for the class name. Components have been utilized more within other components, for instance Dialog close button is not actually a PrimeNG button so that closeButtonProps can be used to enable the features of button like outlined, raised and more.

## Renamedcomponents

Renamed Components Old names are deprecated but still functional, migrate to new import paths instead e.g. primeng/calendar becomes primeng/datepicker . Calendar -&gt; DatePicker . Dropdown -&gt; Select . InputSwitch -&gt; ToggleSwitch . OverlayPanel -&gt; Popover . Sidebar -&gt; Drawer .

# Migration v20

Migration guide to PrimeNG v20.

## Backwardcompatible

Form Enhancements In this iteration, all form components have been reviewed and new demos for template-driven and reactive forms have been added. During this work, limitations have been identified and resolved as well. In addition, we've introduced a new property named invalid to the form components that you may use style a component as invalid. In previous versions, form components style themselves as invalid using a built-in style like the following. This style is opinionated as it is specifally for invalid and dirty states ignoring other potential UX requirements like touched/untouched or form submit. In v20, the new invalid provides full control to highlight a component a invalid. This styling change is backward compatible, meaning the opinionated ng-invalid.ng-dirty class is still included however in future versions, it will be removed. PrimeUIX Themes PrimeUIX is a shared package between all Prime libraries, this shared approach allows PrimeTek teams to share theming and the Design team who is responsible for the Figma UI Kit to work on a single design file, which is the single source of truth. Prior to v20, PrimeNG has its own fork in default styles and for the design tokens {{ '@' }}primeng/themes package is required. With v20, PrimeNG receives the styles from {{ '@' }}primeuix/styles under the hood and the design tokens as theme presets are loaded from {{ '@' }}primeuix/themes . The components need to be adjusted to fit in the PrimeUIX theming by using the host element where applicable, as a result for the components that use host element (&lt;p-* /&gt;) as their main container, the styleClass became obselete since native class attribute is already available on the custom element. Refer to the documentation of a particular component to find out if styleClass is deprecated. All of these changes are backward compatible, {{ '@' }}primeng/themes use {{ '@' }}primeuix/themes internally, and migration is easy as replacing the dependency {{ '@' }}primeng/themes with {{ '@' }}primeuix/themes in your application.

## Breaking

Our team has put in great deal of effort while updating PrimeNG, and there are no filed breaking changes in v20.

## Overview

PrimeNG v20 is an evolution rather than a revolution compared to v18/v19 that introduced the brand new theming architecture. V20 focuses on form enhancements along with the primeuix migration for shared theming between all Prime projects including PrimeVue, PrimeReact and the upcoming projects such as PrimeUI web components. As of v20, PrimeNG has switched PrimeNG to semantic versioning, and as a result changes are iterative, with a smooth migration strategy and no breaking changes. In the future versions, same approach will be put in action and migrations will be trivial with no breaking changes.

# Migration v21

Migration guide to PrimeNG v21.

## Breaking

Beginning with PrimeNG v20, PrimeTek adopted a no-breaking-change policy for incremental major version updates. PrimeNG v21 maintains this policy with one exception: due to the deprecation of Angular's animations package in Angular v20.2, we have migrated to native CSS-based animations. Consequently, the showTransitionOptions and hideTransitionOptions properties that belong to the animations api are deprecated in v21 and no longer functional. v21 will not cause an error as the properties still exist, however your customizations will be ignored. If you currently use these properties for animation customization, please refer to the new animations documentation for the updated approach. Other than this case, v21 should be a drop-in replacement. If you face with any issues during upgrade, please report an issue using at GitHub.

## Deprecations

The following items are marked as deprecated. API Deprecated Since Replacement Removal Status showTransitionOptions v21 Native CSS animatons v22 hideTransitionOptions v21 Native CSS animatons v22 Directive PT attribute names e.g. ptInputText v21 PT suffix at the end e.g. pInputTextPT v22 contextMenuSelectionMode v21 "joint" mode will be removed in favor of the "separate". Applies to Tree, TreeTable and Table. v22

## Removals

This version contains no API removals. For a list of APIs scheduled for removal in v22, refer to the v20 deprecations section.

## Whatsnew

PrimeNG v21 represents a major advancement in PrimeTek's product vision. Key highlights of this release include: PassThrough attributes for enhanced customization. Unstyled Mode for complete styling flexibility. Modern CSS-based animations . The deprecated provideAnimationsAsync is safe to remove. Initial zoneless support for improved performance. AI-enhanced documentation for better developer experience. Notes The internal packages @primeuix/styles and @primeuix/themes should be version 2.0.2 or higher. These packages are updated automatically with a fresh install. If you encounter any issues with visuals or animations, please verify that you are using the correct versions of these packages.

# Components

# Angular Accordion Component

Accordion groups a collection of contents in tabs.

## accessibility-doc

Screen Reader Accordion header elements have a button role and use aria-controls to define the id of the content section along with aria-expanded for the visibility state. The value to read a header element defaults to the value of the header property and can be customized by defining an aria-label or aria-labelledby property. Each header has a heading role, for which the level is customized by headerAriaLevel and has a default level of 2 as per W3C specifications. Disabled accordions headers use aria-disabled and are excluded from the keybord navigation. The content uses region role, defines an id that matches the aria-controls of the header and aria-labelledby referring to the id of the header. Header Keyboard Support

# Angular AutoComplete Component

AutoComplete is an input component that provides real-time suggestions when being typed.

## accessibility-doc

Screen Reader Value to describe the component can either be provided via label tag combined with inputId prop or using ariaLabelledBy , ariaLabel props. The input element has combobox role in addition to aria-autocomplete , aria-haspopup and aria-expanded attributes. The relation between the input and the popup is created with aria-controls and aria-activedescendant attribute is used to instruct screen reader which option to read during keyboard navigation within the popup list. In multiple mode, chip list uses listbox role whereas each chip has the option role with aria-label set to the label of the chip. The popup list has an id that refers to the aria-controls attribute of the input element and uses listbox as the role. Each list item has option role and an id to match the aria-activedescendant of the input element.

## advanced-chips-doc

This example demonstrates an advanced use case with templating, object handling, dropdown, and multiple mode.

## basic-chips-doc

With ⁠multiple enabled, the AutoComplete component behaves like a chips or tags input. Use addOnBlur , ⁠addOnTab , and ⁠separator properties to customize the keystroke behavior for adding items.

## basic-doc

AutoComplete uses ngModel for two-way binding, requires a list of suggestions and a completeMethod to query for the results. The completeMethod gets the query text as event.query property and should update the suggestions with the search results.

## clear-icon-doc

When showClear is enabled, a clear icon is displayed to clear the value.

## disabled-doc

When disabled is present, the element cannot be edited and focused.

## dropdown-doc

Enabling dropdown property displays a button next to the input field where click behavior of the button is defined using dropdownMode property that takes blank or current as possible values. blank is the default mode to send a query with an empty string whereas current setting sends a query with the current value of the input.

## filled-doc

Specify the variant property as filled to display the component with a higher visual emphasis than the default outlined style.

## float-label-doc

A floating label appears on top of the input field when focused. Visit FloatLabel documentation for more information.

## fluid-doc

The fluid prop makes the component take up the full width of its container when set to true.

## force-selection-doc

ForceSelection mode validates the manual input to check whether it also exists in the suggestions list, if not the input value is cleared to make sure the value passed to the model is always one of the suggestions.

## group-doc

Option grouping is enabled when group property is set to true . group template is available to customize the option groups. All templates get the option instance as the default local template variable.

## ifta-label-doc

IftaLabel is used to create infield top aligned labels. Visit IftaLabel documentation for more information.

## invalid-doc

The invalid state is applied using the ⁠invalid property to indicate failed validation, which can be integrated with Angular Forms.

## multiple-doc

Enable multiple selection mode using the ⁠multiple property to allow users to select more than one value from the autocomplete. When enabled, the value reference must be an array.

## objects-doc

AutoComplete can also work with objects using the optionLabel property that defines the label to display as a suggestion. The value passed to the model would still be the object instance of a suggestion. Here is an example with a Country object that has name and code fields such as &#123;name: "United States", code:"USA"&#125; .

## reactive-forms-doc

AutoComplete can also be used with reactive forms. In this case, the formControlName property is used to bind the component to a form control.

## sizes-doc

AutoComplete provides small and large sizes as alternatives to the base.

## template-doc

AutoComplete offers multiple templates for customization through templating.

## virtual-scroll-doc

Virtual scrolling is an efficient way of rendering the options by displaying a small subset of data in the viewport at any time. When dealing with huge number of options, it is suggested to enable virtual scrolling to avoid performance issues. Usage is simple as setting virtualScroll property to true and defining virtualScrollItemSize to specify the height of an item.

# Angular ConfirmDialog Component

ConfirmDialog is backed by a service utilizing Observables to display confirmation windows easily that can be shared by multiple actions on the same component.

## accessibility-doc

Screen Reader ConfirmDialog component uses alertdialog role along with aria-labelledby referring to the header element however any attribute is passed to the root element so you may use aria-labelledby to override this default behavior. In addition aria-modal is added since focus is kept within the popup. It is recommended to use a trigger component that can be accessed with keyboard such as a button, if not adding tabIndex would be necessary. When confirm function is used and a trigger is passed as a parameter, ConfirmDialog adds aria-expanded state attribute and aria-controls to the trigger so that the relation between the trigger and the popup is defined. If the dialog is controlled with the visible property aria-expanded and aria-controls need to be handled explicitly. Overlay Keyboard Support Key Function tab Moves focus to the next the focusable element within the popup. shift + tab Moves focus to the previous the focusable element within the popup. escape Closes the popup and moves focus to the trigger. Buttons Keyboard Support Key Function enter Triggers the action, closes the popup and moves focus to the trigger. space Triggers the action, closes the popup and moves focus to the trigger.

## basic-doc

ConfirmDialog is defined using p-confirmdialog tag and an instance of ConfirmationService is required to display it bycalling confirm method.

## headless-doc

Headless mode allows you to customize the entire user interface instead of the default elements.

## position-doc

The position property of the confirm options is used to display a Dialog at all edges and corners of the screen.

## template-doc

Properties of the dialog are defined in two ways, message , icon , header properties can either be defined using confirm method or declaratively on p-confirmDialog ng-template by header , message , icon and footer templates. If these values are unlikely to change then declarative approach would be useful, still properties defined in a ng-template can be overridden with confirm method call. In addition, buttons at footer section can be customized by passing your own UI, important note to make confirmation work with a custom UI is defining a local ng-template variable for the dialog and assign accept()-reject() methods to your own buttons.

## Confirm Dialog

ConfirmDialog uses a Dialog UI that is integrated with the Confirmation API.

# Angular Dialog Component

Dialog is a container to display content in an overlay window.

## accessibility-doc

Screen Reader Dialog component uses dialog role along with aria-labelledby referring to the header element however any attribute is passed to the root element so you may use aria-labelledby to override this default behavior. In addition aria-modal is added since focus is kept within the popup. It is recommended to use a trigger component that can be accessed with keyboard such as a button, if not adding tabIndex would be necessary. Trigger element also requires aria-expanded and aria-controls to be handled explicitly. Close element is a button with an aria-label that refers to the aria.close property of the locale API by default, you may use closeButtonProps to customize the element and override the default aria-label . Maximize element is a button with an aria-label that refers to the aria.maximizeLabel and aria.minimizeLabel property of the locale API. It cannot be customized using the maximizeButtonProps . Overlay Keyboard Support Key Function tab Moves focus to the next the focusable element within the dialog. shift + tab Moves focus to the previous the focusable element within the dialog. escape Closes the dialog if closeOnEscape is true. Close Button Keyboard Support Key Function enter Closes the dialog. space Closes the dialog.

# Angular Dynamic Dialog Component

Dialogs can be created dynamically with any component as the content using a DialogService.

## close-doc

Most of the time, requirement is returning a value from the dialog. DialogRef's close method is used for this purpose where the parameter passed will be available at the onClose event at the caller. Here is an example on how to close the dialog from the ProductListDemo by passing a selected product.

## customization-doc

DynamicDialog uses the Dialog component internally, visit dialog for more information about the available props.

## example-doc

Dynamic dialogs require an instance of a DialogService that is responsible for displaying a dialog with a component as its content. Calling open method of DialogService will display dynamic dialog. First parameter of open method is the type of component to load and the second parameter is the configuration of the Dialog such as header , width and more.

## open-doc

The open method of the DialogService is used to open a Dialog. First parameter is the component to load and second one is the configuration object to customize the Dialog.

## passingdata-doc

To pass data to a dynamically loaded component, you can use either the data or inputValues property, depending on your requirements. The data property is ideal for passing generic information that is not directly tied to the component's inputs, while inputValues allows you to set specific input properties on the component in a more structured and type-safe way. Both properties can be used together or independently, offering flexibility to meet different use cases. Additionally, the loaded component can control the dialog using the DynamicDialogRef API, providing complete control over the dialog lifecycle. Both DynamicDialogConfig and DynamicDialogRef are injectable through the constructor.

## style-doc

Following is the list of structural style classes, for theming classes visit theming page.

## usage-doc

To use dynamic dialog, a reference should be declared as DynamicDialogRef after the DialogService injected into the component.

# Angular Fluid Component

Fluid is a layout component to make descendant components span full width of their container.

## accessibility-doc

Screen Reader Fluid does not require any roles and attributes. Keyboard Support Component does not include any interactive elements.

## basic-doc

Components with the fluid option like InputText have the ability to span the full width of their component. Enabling the fluid for each component individually may be cumbersome so wrap the content with Fluid to instead for an easier alternative. Any component that has the fluid property can be nested inside the Fluid component. The fluid property of a child component has higher precedence than the fluid container as shown in the last sample.

The slides container has aria-live attribute set as "polite" if galleria is not in autoplay mode, otherwise "off" would be the value in autoplay. A slide has a group role with an aria-label that refers to the aria.slideNumber property of the locale API. Similarly aria.slide is used as the aria-roledescription of the item. Inactive slides are hidden from the readers with aria-hidden . Next and Previous navigators are button elements with aria-label attributes referring to the aria.nextPageLabel and aria.firstPageLabel properties of the locale API by default respectively, you may still use your own aria roles and attributes as any valid attribute is passed to the button elements implicitly by using nextButtonProps and prevButtonProps . Quick navigation elements and thumnbails follow the tab pattern. They are placed inside an element with a tablist role whereas each item has a tab role with aria-selected and aria-controls attributes. The aria-label attribute of a quick navigation item refers to the aria.pageLabel of the locale API. Current page is marked with aria-current . In full screen mode, modal element uses dialog role with aria-modal enabled. The close button retrieves aria-label from the aria.close property of the locale API. Next/Prev Keyboard Support Key Function tab Moves focus through interactive elements in the carousel. enter Activates navigation. space Activates navigation. Quick Navigation Keyboard Support Key Function tab Moves focus through the active slide link. enter Activates the focused slide link. space Activates the focused slide link. right arrow Moves focus to the next slide link. left arrow Moves focus to the previous slide link. home Moves focus to the first slide link. end Moves focus to the last slide link.

# Angular MultiSelect Component

MultiSelect is used to select multiple items from a collection.

## accessibility-doc

Screen Reader Value to describe the component can either be provided with ariaLabelledBy or ariaLabel props. The multiselect component has a combobox role in addition to aria-haspopup and aria-expanded attributes. The relation between the combobox and the popup is created with aria-controls attribute that refers to the id of the popup listbox. The popup listbox uses listbox as the role with aria-multiselectable enabled. Each list item has an option role along with aria-label , aria-selected and aria-disabled attributes. Checkbox component at the header uses a hidden native checkbox element internally that is only visible to screen readers. Value to read is defined with the selectAll and unselectAll keys of the aria property from the locale API. If filtering is enabled, filterInputProps can be defined to give aria-* props to the input element. Close button uses close key of the aria property from the locale API as the aria-label by default, this can be overriden with the closeButtonProps .

## basic-doc

MultiSelect is used as a controlled component with ngModel property along with an options collection. Label and value of an option are defined with the optionLabel and optionValue properties respectively. Default property name for the optionLabel is label and value for the optionValue . If optionValue is omitted and the object has no value property, the object itself becomes the value of an option. Note that, when options are simple primitive values such as a string array, no optionLabel and optionValue would be necessary.

## chips-doc

Selected values are displayed as a comma separated list by default, setting display as chip displays them as chips.

## clearicon-doc

When showClear is enabled, a clear icon is displayed to clear the value.

## disabled-doc

When disabled is present, the element cannot be edited and focused.

## filled-doc

Specify the variant property as filled to display the component with a higher visual emphasis than the default outlined style.

## filter-doc

MultiSelect provides built-in filtering that is enabled by adding the filter property.

## floatlabel-doc

A floating label appears on top of the input field when focused. Visit FloatLabel documentation for more information.

## fluid-doc

The fluid prop makes the component take up the full width of its container when set to true.

## group-doc

Options can be grouped when a nested data structures is provided.

## iftalabel-doc

IftaLabel is used to create infield top aligned labels. Visit IftaLabel documentation for more information.

## invalid-doc

The invalid state is applied using the ⁠invalid property to indicate failed validation, which can be integrated with Angular Forms.

## loadingstate-doc

Loading state can be used loading property.

## reactiveforms-doc

MultiSelect can also be used with reactive forms. In this case, the formControlName property is used to bind the component to a form control.

## sizes-doc

MultiSelect provides small and large sizes as alternatives to the base.

## template-doc

Available options and the selected options support customization with item and selecteditems templates respectively. In addition, header, footer and filter sections can be templated as well.

## virtualscroll-doc

VirtualScrolling is an efficient way of rendering the options by displaying a small subset of data in the viewport at any time. When dealing with huge number of options, it is suggested to enable VirtualScrolling to avoid performance issues. Usage is simple as setting virtualScroll property to true and defining virtualScrollItemSize to specify the height of an item.

# Angular OrderList Component

OrderList is used to sort a collection.

## accessibility-doc

Screen Reader Value to describe the source listbox and target listbox can be provided with sourceListProps and targetListProps by passing aria-labelledby or aria-label props. The list elements has a listbox role with the aria-multiselectable attribute. Each list item has an option role with aria-selected and aria-disabled as their attributes. Controls buttons are button elements with an aria-label that refers to the aria.moveTop , aria.moveUp , aria.moveDown , aria.moveBottom , aria.moveTo , aria.moveAllTo , aria.moveFrom and aria.moveAllFrom properties of the locale API by default, alternatively you may use moveTopButtonProps , moveUpButtonProps , moveDownButtonProps , moveToButtonProps , moveAllToButtonProps , moveFromButtonProps , moveFromButtonProps and moveAllFromButtonProps to customize the buttons like overriding the default aria-label attributes. OrderList Keyboard Support Key Function tab Moves focus to the first selected option, if there is none then first option receives the focus. up arrow Moves focus to the previous option. down arrow Moves focus to the next option. enter Toggles the selected state of the focused option. space Toggles the selected state of the focused option. home Moves focus to the first option. end Moves focus to the last option. shift + down arrow Moves focus to the next option and toggles the selection state. shift + up arrow Moves focus to the previous option and toggles the selection state. shift + space Selects the items between the most recently selected option and the focused option. control + shift + home Selects the focused options and all the options up to the first one. control + shift + end Selects the focused options and all the options down to the first one. control + a Selects all options. Buttons Keyboard Support Key Function enter Executes button action. space Executes button action.

# Overlay API - PrimeNG

This API allows overlay components to be controlled from the PrimeNG. In this way, all overlay components in the application can have the same behavior.

## accessibility-doc

Screen Reader Overlay component uses dialog role and since any attribute is passed to the root element you may define attributes like aria-label or aria-labelledby to describe the popup contents. In addition aria-modal is added since focus is kept within the popup. It is recommended to use a trigger component that can be accessed with keyboard such as a button, if not adding tabIndex would be necessary. Overlay adds aria-expanded state attribute and aria-controls to the trigger so that the relation between the trigger and the popup is defined. Overlay Keyboard Support When the popup gets opened, the first focusable element receives the focus and this can be customized by adding autofocus to an element within the popup. Key Function tab Moves focus to the next the focusable element within the popup. shift + tab Moves focus to the previous the focusable element within the popup. escape Closes the popup and moves focus to the trigger.

# Angular Virtual Scroller Component

VirtualScroller is a performance-approach to handle huge data efficiently.

## accessibility-doc

Screen Reader VirtualScroller uses a semantic list element to list the items. No specific role is enforced, still you may use any aria role and attributes as any valid attribute is passed to the container element. Keyboard Support Component does not include any built-in interactive elements.

## basic-doc

VirtualScroller requires items as the data to display, itemSize for the dimensions of an item and item template are required on component. In addition, an initial array is required based on the total number of items to display. Size of the viewport is configured using scrollWidth , scrollHeight properties directly or with CSS width and height styles.

## delay-doc

Scroll delay is adjusted by using delay property.

## grid-doc

Scrolling can be enabled vertically and horizontally when orientation is set as both . In this mode, itemSize should be an array where first value is the height of an item and second is the width.

## horizontal-doc

Setting orientation to horizontal enables scrolling horizontally. In this case, the itemSize should refer to the width of an item.

## lazyload-doc

Lazy mode is handy to deal with large datasets where instead of loading the entire data, small chunks of data are loaded on demand by invoking onLazyLoad callback everytime scrolling requires a new chunk. To implement lazy loading, enable lazy attribute, initialize your data as a placeholder with a length and finally implement a method callback using onLazyLoad that actually loads a chunk from a datasource. onLazyLoad gets an event object that contains information about the chunk of data to load such as the index and number of items to load. Notice that a new template called loadingItem is also required to display as a placeholder while the new items are being loaded.

## loader-doc

Busy state is enabled by adding showLoader property which blocks the UI with a modal by default. Alternatively, loader template can be used to customize items e.g. with Skeleton .

## programmatic-doc

Scrolling to a specific index can be done with the scrollToIndex function.

## scrolloptions-doc

The properties of scroller component can be used like an object in it.

## template-doc

Scroller content is customizable by using ng-template . Valid values are content , item , loader and loadericon

# Angular StyleClass Component

StyleClass manages css classes declaratively to during enter/leave animations or just to toggle classes on an element.

## animation-doc

Classes to apply during enter and leave animations are specified using the enterFromClass , enterActiveClass , enterToClass , leaveFromClass , leaveActiveClass , leaveToClass properties. In addition in case the target is an overlay, hideOnOutsideClick would be handy to hide the target if outside of the popup is clicked, or enable hideOnEscape to close the popup by listening escape key.

## hideonresize-doc

When hideOnResize is enabled, the leave animation is triggered automatically when resizing occurs. Use the resizeSelector property to specify whether to listen to window resize events or element-specific resize events. Set resizeSelector to "window" (default) or "document" for browser resize, or a CSS selector to observe the target element's dimensions.

## toggleclass-doc

StyleClass has two modes, toggleClass to simply add-remove a class and enter/leave animations. The target element to change the styling is defined with the selector property that accepts any valid CSS selector or keywords including &#64;next , prev , parent , grandparent

# Angular Table Component

Table displays data in tabular format.

## accessibility-doc

Screen Reader Default role of the table is table . Header, body and footer elements use rowgroup , rows use row role, header cells have columnheader and body cells use cell roles. Sortable headers utilizer aria-sort attribute either set to "ascending" or "descending". Table rows and table cells should be specified by users using the aria-posinset , aria-setsize , aria-label , and aria-describedby attributes, as they are determined through templating. Built-in checkbox and radiobutton components for row selection use checkbox and radiobutton . The label to describe them is retrieved from the aria.selectRow and aria.unselectRow properties of the locale API. Similarly header checkbox uses selectAll and unselectAll keys. When a row is selected, aria-selected is set to true on a row. The element to expand or collapse a row is a button with aria-expanded and aria-controls properties. Value to describe the buttons is derived from aria.expandRow and aria.collapseRow properties of the locale API. The filter menu button use aria.showFilterMenu and aria.hideFilterMenu properties as aria-label in addition to the aria-haspopup , aria-expanded and aria-controls to define the relation between the button and the overlay. Popop menu has dialog role with aria-modal as focus is kept within the overlay. The operator dropdown use aria.filterOperator and filter constraints dropdown use aria.filterConstraint properties. Buttons to add rules on the other hand utilize aria.addRule and aria.removeRule properties. The footer buttons similarly use aria.clear and aria.apply properties. filterInputProps of the Column component can be used to define aria labels for the built-in filter components, if a custom component is used with templating you also may define your own aria labels as well. Editable cells use custom templating so you need to manage aria roles and attributes manually if required. The row editor controls are button elements with aria.editRow , aria.cancelEdit and aria.saveEdit used for the aria-label . Paginator is a standalone component used inside the Table, refer to the paginator for more information about the accessibility features. Keyboard Support Any button element inside the Table used for cases like filter, row expansion, edit are tabbable and can be used with space and enter keys. Sortable Headers Keyboard Support Key Function tab Moves through the headers. enter Sorts the column. space Sorts the column. Filter Menu Keyboard Support Key Function tab Moves through the elements inside the popup. escape Hides the popup. enter Opens the popup. Selection Keyboard Support Key Function tab Moves focus to the first selected row, if there is none then first row receives the focus. up arrow Moves focus to the previous row. down arrow Moves focus to the next row. enter Toggles the selected state of the focused row depending on the metaKeySelection setting. space Toggles the selected state of the focused row depending on the metaKeySelection setting. home Moves focus to the first row. end Moves focus to the last row. shift + down arrow Moves focus to the next row and toggles the selection state. shift + up arrow Moves focus to the previous row and toggles the selection state. shift + space Selects the rows between the most recently selected row and the focused row. control + shift + home Selects the focused rows and all the options up to the first one. control + shift + end Selects the focused rows and all the options down to the last one. control + a Selects all rows.

## basic-doc

DataTable requires a collection to display along with column components for the representation of the data.

## celledit-doc

In-cell editing is enabled by adding pEditableColumn directive to an editable cell that has a p-cellEditor helper component to define the input-output templates for the edit and view modes respectively.

## checkboxselection-doc

Multiple selection can also be handled using checkboxes by enabling the selectionMode property of column as multiple .

## columngroup-doc

Columns can be grouped using rowspan and colspan properties.

## columnresizeexpandmode-doc

Setting columnResizeMode as expand changes the table width as well.

## columnresizefitmode-doc

Columns can be resized using drag drop by setting the resizableColumns to true . Fit mode is the default one and the overall table width does not change when a column is resized.

## columnselection-doc

Row selection with an element inside a column is implemented with templating.

## columntoggle-doc

This demo uses a multiselect component to implement toggleable columns.

## contextmenu-doc

Table has exclusive integration with contextmenu component. In order to attach a menu to a table, add pContextMenuRow directive to the rows that can be selected with context menu, define a local template variable for the menu and bind it to the contextMenu property of the table. This enables displaying the menu whenever a row is right clicked. Optional pContextMenuRowIndex property is available to access the row index. A separate contextMenuSelection property is used to get a hold of the right clicked row. For dynamic columns, setting pContextMenuRowDisabled property as true disables context menu for that particular row.

## controlledselection-doc

Row selection can be controlled by utilizing rowSelectable and disabled properties.

## customers-doc

DataTable with selection, pagination, filtering, sorting and templating.

## dynamic-doc

Columns can be defined dynamically using the *ngFor directive.

## expandablerowgroup-doc

When expandableRowGroups is present in subheader based row grouping, groups can be expanded and collapsed. State of the expansions are controlled using the expandedRows and onRowToggle properties.

## export-doc

Table can export its data to CSV format.

## filter-advanced-doc

Filters are displayed in an overlay.

## filterbasic-doc

Data filtering is enabled by defining the filters property referring to a DataTableFilterMeta instance. Each column to filter also requires filter to be enabled. Built-in filter element is a input field and using filterElement , it is possible to customize the filtering with your own UI. The optional global filtering searches the data against a single value that is bound to the global key of the filters object. The fields to search against is defined with the globalFilterFields .

## flexiblescroll-doc

Flex scroll feature makes the scrollable viewport section dynamic instead of a fixed value so that it can grow or shrink relative to the parent size of the table. Click the button below to display a maximizable Dialog where data viewport adjusts itself according to the size changes.

## frozencolumns-doc

Certain columns can be frozen by using the pFrozenColumn directive of the table component. In addition, alignFrozen is available to define whether the column should be fixed on the left or right.

## frozenrows-doc

Frozen rows are used to fix certain rows while scrolling, this data is defined with the frozenValue property.

## gridlines-doc

Enabling showGridlines displays borders between cells.

## horizontalscroll-doc

Horizontal scrollbar is displayed when table width exceeds the parent width.

## lazyload-doc

Lazy mode is handy to deal with large datasets, instead of loading the entire data, small chunks of data is loaded by invoking onLazyLoad callback everytime paging , sorting and filtering happens. Sample here loads the data from remote datasource efficiently using lazy loading. Also, the implementation of checkbox selection in lazy tables is left entirely to the user. Since the table component does not know what will happen to the data on the next page or whether there are instant data changes, the selection array can be implemented in several ways. One of them is as in the example below.

## loadingmask-doc

The loading property displays a mask layer to indicate busy state. Use the paginator to display the mask.

## loadingskeleton-doc

Skeleton component can be used as a placeholder during the loading process.

## multiplecolumnssort-doc

Multiple columns can be sorted by defining sortMode as multiple . This mode requires metaKey (e.g. ⌘ ) to be pressed when clicking a header.

## multipleselection-doc

More than one row is selectable by setting selectionMode to multiple . By default in multiple selection mode, metaKey press (e.g. ⌘ ) is not necessary to add to existing selections. When the optional metaKeySelection is present, behavior is changed in a way that selecting a new row requires meta key to be present. Note that in touch enabled devices, DataTable always ignores metaKey.

## paginatorbasic-doc

Pagination is enabled by setting paginator property to true and defining a rows property to specify the number of rows per page.

## paginatorlocale-doc

paginator localization information such as page numbers and rows per page options are defined with the paginatorLocale property which defaults to the user locale.

## paginatorprogrammatic-doc

Paginator can also be controlled via model using a binding to the first property where changes trigger a pagination.

## presort-doc

Defining a default sortField and sortOrder displays data as sorted initially in single column sorting. In multiple sort mode, multiSortMeta should be used instead by providing an array of DataTableSortMeta objects.

## products-doc

CRUD implementation example with a Dialog.

## radiobuttonselection-doc

Single selection can also be handled using radio buttons.

## removablesort-doc

The removable sort can be implemented using the customSort property.

## reorder-doc

Order of the columns and rows can be changed using drag and drop. Column reordering is configured by adding reorderableColumns property. Similarly, adding reorderableRows property enables draggable rows. For the drag handle a column needs to have rowReorder property and onRowReorder callback is required to control the state of the rows after reorder completes.

## rowedit-doc

Row editing toggles the visibility of all the editors in the row at once and provides additional options to save and cancel editing. Row editing functionality is enabled by setting the editMode to "row" on table, defining a dataKey to uniquely identify a row, adding pEditableRow directive to the editable rows and defining the UI Controls with pInitEditableRow , pSaveEditableRow and pCancelEditableRow directives respectively. Save and Cancel functionality implementation is left to the page author to provide more control over the editing business logic. Example below utilizes a simple implementation where a row is cloned when editing is initialized and is saved or restored depending on the result of the editing. An implicit variable called "editing" is passed to the body template so you may come up with your own UI controls that implement editing based on your own requirements such as adding validations and styling. Note that pSaveEditableRow only switches the row to back view mode when there are no validation errors. Moreover, you may use setting pEditableRowDisabled property as true to disable editing for that particular row and in case you need to display rows in edit mode by default, use the editingRowKeys property which is a map whose key is the dataKey of the record where the value is any arbitrary number greater than zero.

## rowexpansion-doc

Row expansion allows displaying detailed content for a particular row. To use this feature, define a dataKey , add a template named expandedrow and use the pRowToggler directive on an element as the target to toggle an expansion. This enables providing your custom UI such as buttons, links and so on. Example below uses an anchor with an icon as a toggler. Setting pRowTogglerDisabled as true disables the toggle event for the element.

## rowspangrouping-doc

When rowGroupMode is configured to be rowspan , the grouping column spans multiple rows.

## selectionevents-doc

Table provides onRowSelect and onRowUnselect events to listen selection events.

## singlecolumnsort-doc

A column can be made sortable by adding the pSortableColumn directive whose value is the field to sort against and a sort indicator via p-sortIcon component. For dynamic columns, setting pSortableColumnDisabled property as true disables sorting for that particular column. Default sorting is executed on a single column, in order to enable multiple field sorting, set sortMode property to "multiple" and use metakey when clicking on another column.

## singleselection-doc

Single row selection is enabled by defining selectionMode as single along with a value binding using selection property. When available, it is suggested to provide a unique identifier of a row with dataKey to optimize performance. By default, metaKey press (e.g. ⌘ ) is necessary to unselect a row however this can be configured with disabling the metaKeySelection property. In touch enabled devices this option has no effect and behavior is same as setting it to false.

## size-doc

In addition to a regular table, alternatives with alternative sizes are available.

## stateful-doc

Stateful table allows keeping the state such as page, sort and filtering either at local storage or session storage so that when the page is visited again, table would render the data using the last settings. Change the state of the table e.g paginate, navigate away and then return to this table again to test this feature, the setting is set as session with the stateStorage property so that Table retains the state until the browser is closed. Other alternative is local referring to localStorage for an extended lifetime.

## striped-doc

Alternating rows are displayed when stripedRows property is present.

## style-doc

Certain rows or cells can easily be styled based on conditions.

## subheadergrouping-doc

Rows are grouped with the groupRowsBy property. When rowGroupMode is set as subheader , a header and footer can be displayed for each group. The content of a group header is provided with groupheader and footer with groupfooter templates.

## template-doc

Custom content at header , body and footer sections are supported via templating.

## virtualscroll-doc

Virtual Scrolling is an efficient way to render large amount data. Usage is similar to regular scrolling with the addition of virtualScrollerOptions property to define a fixed itemSize . Internally, VirtualScroller component is utilized so refer to the API of VirtualScroller for more information about the available options. In this example, 10000 preloaded records are rendered by the Table.

## virtualscrolllazy-doc

VirtualScroller is a performance-approach to handle huge data efficiently. Setting virtualScroll property as true and providing a virtualScrollItemSize in pixels would be enough to enable this functionality. It is also suggested to use the same virtualScrollItemSize value on the tr element inside the body template.

## Table

Table displays data in tabular format.

# Angular TieredMenu Component

TieredMenu displays submenus in nested overlays.

## accessibility-doc

Screen Reader TieredMenu component uses the menubar role with aria-orientation set to "vertical" and the value to describe the menu can either be provided with aria-labelledby or aria-label props. Each list item has a presentation role whereas anchor elements have a menuitem role with aria-label referring to the label of the item and aria-disabled defined if the item is disabled. A submenu within a TieredMenu uses the menu role with an aria-labelledby defined as the id of the submenu root menuitem label. In addition, menuitems that open a submenu have aria-haspopup , aria-expanded and aria-controls to define the relation between the item and the submenu. In popup mode, the component implicitly manages the aria-expanded , aria-haspopup and aria-controls attributes of the target element to define the relation between the target and the popup. Keyboard Support Key Function tab Add focus to the first item if focus moves in to the menu. If the focus is already within the menu, focus moves to the next focusable item in the page tab sequence. shift + tab Add focus to the last item if focus moves in to the menu. If the focus is already within the menu, focus moves to the previous focusable item in the page tab sequence. enter If menuitem has a submenu, toggles the visibility of the submenu otherwise activates the menuitem and closes all open overlays. space If menuitem has a submenu, toggles the visibility of the submenu otherwise activates the menuitem and closes all open overlays. escape If focus is inside a popup submenu, closes the submenu and moves focus to the root item of the closed submenu. down arrow Moves focus to the next menuitem within the submenu. up arrow Moves focus to the previous menuitem within the submenu. right arrow Opens a submenu if there is one available and moves focus to the first item. left arrow Closes a submenu and moves focus to the root item of the closed submenu. home Moves focus to the first menuitem within the submenu. end Moves focus to the last menuitem within the submenu.

# Angular Tree Component

Tree is used to display hierarchical data.

## accessibility-doc

Screen Reader Value to describe the component can either be provided with aria-labelledby or aria-label props. The root list element has a tree role whereas each list item has a treeitem role along with aria-label , aria-selected and aria-expanded attributes. In checkbox selection, aria-checked is used instead of aria-selected . The container element of a treenode has the group role. Checkbox and toggle icons are hidden from screen readers as their parent element with treeitem role and attributes are used instead for readers and keyboard support. The aria-setsize , aria-posinset and aria-level attributes are calculated implicitly and added to each treeitem. Keyboard Support Key Function tab Moves focus to the first selected node when focus enters the component, if there is none then first element receives the focus. If focus is already inside the component, moves focus to the next focusable element in the page tab sequence. shift + tab Moves focus to the last selected node when focus enters the component, if there is none then first element receives the focus. If focus is already inside the component, moves focus to the previous focusable element in the page tab sequence. enter Selects the focused treenode. space Selects the focused treenode. down arrow Moves focus to the next treenode. up arrow Moves focus to the previous treenode. right arrow If node is closed, opens the node otherwise moves focus to the first child node. left arrow If node is open, closes the node otherwise moves focus to the parent node.

## basic-doc

Tree component requires an array of TreeNode objects as its value .

## checkbox-doc

Selection of multiple nodes via checkboxes is enabled by configuring selectionMode as checkbox .

## contextmenu-doc

Tree has exclusive integration with ContextMenu using the contextMenu property along with the contextMenuSelection to manage the selection.

## controlled-doc

Tree requires a collection of TreeNode instances as a value .

## event-doc

An event is provided for each type of user interaction such as expand, collapse and selection.

## filter-doc

Filtering is enabled by adding the filter property, by default label property of a node is used to compare against the value in the text field, in order to customize which field(s) should be used during search define filterBy property. In addition filterMode specifies the filtering strategy. In lenient mode when the query matches a node, children of the node are not searched further as all descendants of the node are included. On the other hand, in strict mode when the query matches a node, filtering continues on all descendants.

## lazy-doc

Lazy loading is useful when dealing with huge datasets, in this example nodes are dynamically loaded on demand using loading property and onNodeExpand method.

## multiple-doc

More than one node is selectable by setting selectionMode to multiple . By default in multiple selection mode, metaKey press (e.g. ⌘ ) is necessary to add to existing selections however this can be configured with disabling the metaKeySelection property. Note that in touch enabled devices, Tree always ignores metaKey. In multiple selection mode, value binding should be a key-value pair where key is the node key and value is a boolean to indicate selection.

## single-doc

Single node selection is configured by setting selectionMode as single along with selection properties to manage the selection value binding.

## template-doc

Custom node content instead of a node label is defined with the pTemplate property.

## virtualscroll-doc

VirtualScroller is a performance-approach to handle huge data efficiently. Setting virtualScroll property as true and providing a virtualScrollItemSize in pixels would be enough to enable this functionality.

# Angular TreeSelect Component

TreeSelect is a form component to choose from hierarchical data.

## accessibility-doc

Screen Reader Value to describe the component can either be provided with ariaLabelledby or ariaLabel props. The treeselect element has a combobox role in addition to aria-haspopup and aria-expanded attributes. The relation between the combobox and the popup is created with aria-controls that refers to the id of the popup. The popup list has an id that refers to the aria-controls attribute of the combobox element and uses tree as the role. Each list item has a treeitem role along with aria-label , aria-selected and aria-expanded attributes. In checkbox selection, aria-checked is used instead of aria-selected . Checkbox and toggle icons are hidden from screen readers as their parent element with treeitem role and attributes are used instead for readers and keyboard support. The container element of a treenode has the group role. The aria-setsize , aria-posinset and aria-level attributes are calculated implicitly and added to each treeitem. If filtering is enabled, filterInputProps can be defined to give aria-* props to the filter input element.

## basic-doc

TreeSelect is used as a controlled component with ng-model directive along with an options collection. Internally Tree component is used so the options model is based on TreeNode API. In single selection mode, value binding should be the key value of a node.

## checkbox-doc

Selection of multiple nodes via checkboxes is enabled by configuring selectionMode as checkbox .

## clearicon-doc

When showClear is enabled, a clear icon is displayed to clear the value.

## disabled-doc

When disabled is present, the element cannot be edited and focused.

## filled-doc

Specify the variant property as filled to display the component with a higher visual emphasis than the default outlined style.

## filter-doc

Filtering is enabled by adding the filter property, by default label property of a node is used to compare against the value in the text field, in order to customize which field(s) should be used during search define filterBy property. In addition filterMode specifies the filtering strategy. In lenient mode when the query matches a node, children of the node are not searched further as all descendants of the node are included. On the other hand, in strict mode when the query matches a node, filtering continues on all descendants.

## floatlabel-doc

A floating label appears on top of the input field when focused. Visit FloatLabel documentation for more information.

## fluid-doc

The fluid prop makes the component take up the full width of its container when set to true.

## iftalabel-doc

IftaLabel is used to create infield top aligned labels. Visit IftaLabel documentation for more information.

## invalid-doc

The invalid state is applied using the ⁠invalid property to indicate failed validation, which can be integrated with Angular Forms.

## lazy-doc

Lazy loading is useful when dealing with huge datasets, in this example nodes are dynamically loaded on demand using loading property and onNodeExpand method.

## multiple-doc

More than one node is selectable by setting selectionMode to multiple . By default in multiple selection mode, metaKey press (e.g. ⌘ ) is necessary to add to existing selections however this can be configured with disabling the metaKeySelection property. Note that in touch enabled devices, TreeSelect always ignores metaKey. In multiple selection mode, value binding should be a key-value pair where key is the node key and value is a boolean to indicate selection.

## reactiveforms-doc

TreeSelect can also be used with reactive forms. In this case, the formControlName property is used to bind the component to a form control.

## sizes-doc

TreeSelect provides small and large sizes as alternatives to the base.

## template-doc

TreeSelect offers multiple templates for customization through templating.

## virtualscroll-doc

VirtualScrolling is an efficient way of rendering the options by displaying a small subset of data in the viewport at any time. When dealing with huge number of options, it is suggested to enable VirtualScrolling to avoid performance issues. Usage is simple as setting virtualScroll property to true and defining virtualScrollItemSize to specify the height of an item.

# Angular TreeTable Component

TreeTable is used to display hierarchical data in tabular format.

## accessibility-doc

Screen Reader Default role of the table is table . Header, body and footer elements use rowgroup , rows use row role, header cells have columnheader and body cells use cell roles. Sortable headers utilizer aria-sort attribute either set to "ascending" or "descending". Row elements manage aria-expanded for state and aria-level attribute to define the hierachy by ttRow directive. Table rows and table cells should be specified by users using the aria-posinset , aria-setsize , aria-label , and aria-describedby attributes, as they are determined through templating. When selection is enabled, ttSelectableRow directive sets aria-selected to true on a row. In checkbox mode, the built-in checkbox component use checkbox role with aria-checked state attribute. Editable cells use custom templating so you need to manage aria roles and attributes manually if required. Paginator is a standalone component used inside the TreeTable, refer to the paginator for more information about the accessibility features. Sortable Headers Keyboard Support Key Function tab Moves through the headers. enter Sorts the column. space Sorts the column. Keyboard Support Key Function tab Moves focus to the first selected node when focus enters the component, if there is none then first element receives the focus. If focus is already inside the component, moves focus to the next focusable element in the page tab sequence. shift + tab Moves focus to the last selected node when focus enters the component, if there is none then first element receives the focus. If focus is already inside the component, moves focus to the previous focusable element in the page tab sequence. enter Selects the focused treenode. space Selects the focused treenode. down arrow Moves focus to the next treenode. up arrow Moves focus to the previous treenode. right arrow If node is closed, opens the node otherwise moves focus to the first child node. left arrow If node is open, closes the node otherwise moves focus to the parent node.

## basic-doc

TreeTable requires a collection of TreeNode instances as a value components as children for the representation.

## columnresizeexpand-doc

Setting columnResizeMode as expand changes the table width as well.

## columnresizefit-doc

Columns can be resized with drag and drop when resizableColumns is enabled. Default resize mode is fit that does not change the overall table width.

## columnresizescrollable-doc

To utilize the column resize modes with a scrollable TreeTable, a colgroup template must be defined. The default value of scrollHeight is "flex," it can also be set as a string value.

## columntoggle-doc

Column visibility based on a condition can be implemented with dynamic columns, in this sample a MultiSelect is used to manage the visible columns.

## conditionalstyle-doc

Particular rows and cells can be styled based on conditions. The ngClass receives a row data as a parameter to return a style class for a row whereas cells are customized using the body template.

## contextmenu-doc

TreeTable has exclusive integration with contextmenu component. In order to attach a menu to a table, add ttContextMenuRow directive to the rows that can be selected with context menu, define a local template variable for the menu and bind it to the contextMenu property of the table. This enables displaying the menu whenever a row is right clicked. A separate contextMenuSelection property is used to get a hold of the right clicked row. For dynamic columns, setting ttContextMenuRowDisabled property as true disables context menu for that particular row.

## controlled-doc

Expansion state is controlled with expandedKeys property.

## dynamiccolumns-doc

Columns can be created programmatically.

## edit-doc

Incell editing is enabled by defining input elements with treeTableCellEditor .

## filter-doc

The filterMode specifies the filtering strategy, in lenient mode when the query matches a node, children of the node are not searched further as all descendants of the node are included. On the other hand, in strict mode when the query matches a node, filtering continues on all descendants. A general filled called filterGlobal is also provided to search all columns that support filtering.

## flexiblescroll-doc

Flex scroll feature makes the scrollable viewport section dynamic instead of a fixed value so that it can grow or shrink relative to the parent size of the table. Click the button below to display a maximizable Dialog where data viewport adjusts itself according to the size changes.

## gridlines-doc

Enabling showGridlines displays grid lines.

## lazyload-doc

Lazy mode is handy to deal with large datasets, instead of loading the entire data, small chunks of data is loaded by invoking corresponding callbacks everytime paging , sorting and filtering occurs. Sample below imitates lazy loading data from a remote datasource using an in-memory list and timeouts to mimic network connection. Enabling the lazy property and assigning the logical number of rows to totalRecords by doing a projection query are the key elements of the implementation so that paginator displays the UI assuming there are actually records of totalRecords size although in reality they are not present on page, only the records that are displayed on the current page exist. In addition, only the root elements should be loaded, children can be loaded on demand using onNodeExpand callback.

## loadingmask-doc

The loading property displays a mask layer to indicate busy state. Use the paginator to display the mask.

## loadingskeleton-doc

Skeleton component can be used as a placeholder during the loading process.

## paginatorbasic-doc

Pagination is enabled by adding paginator property and defining rows per page.

## paginatortemplate-doc

Paginator UI is customized using the paginatorleft and paginatorright property. Each element can also be customized further with your own UI to replace the default one, refer to the Paginator component for more information about the advanced customization options.

## reorder-doc

Order of the columns can be changed using drag and drop when reorderableColumns is present.

## scrollfrozencolumns-doc

A column can be fixed during horizontal scrolling by enabling the frozenColumns property.

## scrollhorizontal-doc

Horizontal scrolling is enabled when the total width of columns exceeds table width.

## scrollvertical-doc

Adding scrollable property along with a scrollHeight for the data viewport enables vertical scrolling with fixed headers.

## selectioncheckbox-doc

Selection of multiple nodes via checkboxes is enabled by configuring selectionMode as checkbox . In checkbox selection mode, value binding should be a key-value pair where key (or the dataKey) is the node key and value is an object that has checked and partialChecked properties to represent the checked state of a node.

## selectioneventsc-doc

TreeTable provides onNodeSelect and onNodeUnselect events to listen selection events.

## selectionmultiple-doc

More than one node is selectable by setting selectionMode to multiple . By default in multiple selection mode, metaKey press (e.g. ⌘ ) is necessary to add to existing selections however this can be configured with disabling the metaKeySelection property. Note that in touch enabled devices, TreeTable always ignores metaKey.

## selectionsingle-doc

Single node selection is configured by setting selectionMode as single along with selection properties to manage the selection value binding. By default, metaKey press (e.g. ⌘ ) is necessary to unselect a node however this can be configured with disabling the metaKeySelection property. In touch enabled devices this option has no effect and behavior is same as setting it to false

## size-doc

In addition to a regular treetable, alternatives with alternative sizes are available. Add p-treetable-sm class to reduce the size of treetable or p-treetable-lg to enlarge it.

## sortmultiplecolumns-doc

Multiple columns can be sorted by defining sortMode as multiple . This mode requires metaKey (e.g. ⌘ ) to be pressed when clicking a header.

## sortremovable-doc

The removable sort can be implemented using the customSort property.

## sortsinglecolumn-doc

Sorting on a column is enabled by adding the ttSortableColumn property.

## template-doc

Custom content at caption , header , body and summary sections are supported via templating.

## Tree Table

TreeTable is used to display hierarchical data in tabular format.

Primitive This set contains the most foundational tokens, such as base colors and border radius, elements that are considered “primitive” by nature. Semantic Includes essential system-wide tokens like primary, surface, and other shared design values It also defines tokens used across multiple component groups. For example, tokens under &#123;form.field.*&#125; are referenced by component-level tokens in InputText, MultiSelect, Checkbox, and other form components, enabling consistent styling across the board. Component These tokens are defined specifically for each component to allow deep customization While we've aimed to create dedicated tokens for every component state, many of them still reference the semantic or primitive tokens, allowing you to make global updates from a single place when needed. App Tokens in this set are not part of the PrimeUIX system. They are intended for values defined in your own application. The same applies to tokens used in our UI library showcases. For example, there is no dedicated font size token in PrimeUIX because font styles are not part of the design system. UI components inherit their font settings from the application. Custom If you're using the Figma to Theme feature and want your newly created custom tokens to appear in your Theme Designer themes, place them in this set. Even if you're not using the Theme Designer, we still recommend creating a separate set — or using the existing “Custom” set — for your own tokens. Making changes to the default sets, especially deleting tokens or altering reference values, can lead to inconsistencies with the library tokens and cause additional work during development.

## updateprimeone-doc

When a new version of PrimeOne is released, follow the steps below to update your files: Download the latest version of PrimeOne from PrimeStore. Unzip the file and upload it to your Figma workspace. Publish the newly uploaded file as a library. In all consumer files, use Swap Library to point to the new version. Once the transition is complete, you can safely unpublish the old PrimeOne library Before each update, it's a good idea to review the Changelog on the Get Started page of the PrimeOne Figma file. Keep in mind that while Swap Library will update most components, any customized components may require manual review and adjustment.
