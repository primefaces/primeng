                <p>Each update will come as a new Figma file—an updated version of the previous one. You can seamlessly transition to the new version in your consumer files using Figma's <b>Swap Library</b> feature.</p>

                <p>The PrimeOne UI Kit does not update in real time alongside the libraries. However, we regularly release updates to bridge the gap and ensure alignment with key changes.</p>
