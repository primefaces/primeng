            <p>
                <a href="https://primeflex.org">PrimeFlex</a> is designed to be a lightweight CSS utility to accompany Prime UI libraries. As part of our product roadmap planning at PrimeTek, the team has decided to avoid the maintenance of a CSS
                library and utilize the resources on improving the UI libraries instead. Community feedback has been essential in this decision as well since majority of the applications have their own CSS utilities whether it is Tailwind, Bootstrap
                or an in-house one, as a result adding PrimeFlex to a project was causing overlapping functionality.
